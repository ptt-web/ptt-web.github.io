let me ask you one thing
If Santana did not have NTC. Twins agreed to send Santana to Mets for several
prospects. Santana would have to go because he did not have NTC. Mets got
Santana and the right to negotiate with him for a long term deal wihout other
teams&#39; involvements. Do you agree that Mets would have been in a risk of
losing Santana for nothing? They paid 4 prospects for him but he can still
walk away after the season is over. If you were Mets&#39; GM, which way you want
to go, make the trade and long term deal together or seperate them?

From Santana&#39;s perspective, signing a long term deal rather than entering FA
market is not a bad move. He might be able to get more in the FA market. But
what if he was injured during the season? Who knows what can happen in one
year. Taking the money on the talbe is not bad at all.

For Beltran&#39;s case, firstly, his value was not as high as Santana&#39;s. Houston
traded a perspect along with Dotel for him. I dont think that is a big price.
Houston did offer Beltran a contract, maybe not as big as the one from Mets.
But they can afford letting him go because they did not buy him in a very
high price.

</span><span class="f6">: : because Mets want a contract long and big but because Santana had full NTC
</span><span class="f6">: : (no-trade clasue) to void any possible deal that includes him. Mets has to

</span><span class="f6">: : → kafen:a huge contract for that long. So you are right. But      07/05 15:16
</span><span class="f6">: : → kafen:they did not want to simply rent Santana for 1 yr either  07/05 15:17
</span><span class="f6">: : → kafen:especially after giving up that much farm talent          07/05 15:17
</span><span class="f6">:     Let me put it this way. Now, think of two Johan Santana on the trading
</span><span class="f6">: block, one with NTC, the other without. If other things being equal, who will
</span><span class="f6">: be of greater value on trading market? Its the one without NTC that would
</span><span class="f6">: cause the team more prospect to trade for. Why? because I could get that
</span><span class="f6">: Santana without his consent and I could still negotiate for a contract
</span><span class="f6">: extension after I got him when no other team can talk to him.
</span><span class="f6">:     Lets refresh our memory how Santana&#39;s teammate Beltran joined Mets.
</span><span class="f6">: Beltran was first traded to Astros for a few month when Astro was contending.
</span><span class="f6">: Technically, Astros rents Beltran for months. At the end of the season, Mets
</span><span class="f6">: outbid other teams, including Astros, in Boras&#39; auction and signed Beltran to
</span><span class="f6">: a big contract.
</span><span class="f6">:     So, did Astros try to extend Beltran&#39;s contract? I think they probably
</span><span class="f6">: did. But Boras would not take that offer. To Beltran&#39;s best interest, he
</span><span class="f6">: should test the FA market first an take the biggest offer he got.
</span><span class="f6">:     What I am trying to say is that, when a player was put on trading block
</span><span class="f6">: at the last year of his contract, NTC matters. In Santana&#39;s case, he could
</span><span class="f6">: decide not to wave his NTC and played for Twins for a few more months and
</span><span class="f6">: then test FA market to see the crazy GMs outbiding each other. So, whether
</span><span class="f6">: or not a team would sign the trade-in to longterm depends on the price and
</span><span class="f6">: on the attitude of the player, not on how mych talent they gave up.
</span><span class="f6">: e and
