</span><span class="f6">│   -MLB.com&#39;s report on Joba Chamberlain at the time of the 2006 MLB Draft│
</span><span class="f6">└─────────────────────────────────────┘</span>

  Few pitchers have ignited as many debates about the value of a starter vs
  the value of a reliever as Joba Chamberlain.  Drafted with the 41st pick
  in the 2006 MLB Draft (using a supplemental pick gained from the loss of
  reliever Tom Gordon to the Philadelphia Phillies), it wasn&#39;t expected that
  he would make an impact so quickly; at the time, the Yankees star pitching
  prospect, and indeed one of the best pitching prospects in all of baseball,
  was RHP Philip Hughes.

  However, in the first winter after he was drafted, Joba put on a show in
  the now-defunct Hawaii Winter Baseball League.  Facing a mix of Japanese
  and American batters, Joba struck out 46 batters, while walking 3, and
  giving up 1 HR in 37.2 Innings Pitched.  As a result, he started 2007 as
  the #4 prospect in the Yankees&#39; farm system according to Baseball America.
  He soon justified and surpassed this ranking by tearing through all A+, AA,
  and AAA ball with a combined 13.8K/9 and a 5:1 K/BB ratio.  In August,
  after less than one year in the minor leagues, he was called up to the Show
  to perform as a reliever.  And thus, the legend of Joba Chamberlain begins.

  It so happens that Joba&#39;s rise to prominence coincided with the first
  release of full Pitchf/x data, which was first released in 2007 and had
  it&#39;s first complete release of data as we know it today starting in 2008.
  An examination of Joba Chamberlain&#39;s career reveals three different
  pitchers:

<span class="f3 hl">   * The Legend: </span>The Pitcher with the insane stuff that dominated in 2007
<span class="f3 hl">   * The Ace:</span> The #1 Starter that showed up in 2008
<span class="f3 hl">   * The Good Relief Pitcher:</span> The pitcher that&#39;s left after an injury in
                                           Texas in 2008 changed his career.

  To truly understand the divisive opinions about Joba, and to truly be able
  to understand what can be expected out of him further in his career, one
  needs to examine all three of these pitchers.  After the jump, we shall
  do so.


▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁


<span class="f3 hl">Joba, The Legend</span>

<span class="f6">┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
</span><span class="f6">│And you know what? There’s some truth to that. Joba Chamberlain will     │
</span><span class="f6">│never be the pitcher he was in 2007 ever again, and if I had to bet money │

</span><span class="f6">│                                                                          │
</span><span class="f6">│                             -Brien Jackson, It&#39;s About The Money, Stupid!│
</span><span class="f6">└─────────────────────────────────────┘</span>

  Joba&#39;s performance in 2007, prior to the playoffs, was beyond incredible.
  It certainly caught the media&#39;s attention (though it certainly helped that
  Joba was pitching for the Yankees, whom are always in the national media).
  In twenty four innings Joba struck out 34 batters while walking only 6 and
  giving up 1 Home Run.  In fact, that was his only earned run (he had one
  unearned run.  The result was a 0.38 ERA, 1.82 FIP, and 2.42 xFIP, numbers
  that are all pretty damn ridiculous.

  But of course, there was more to the legend than the results: Joba was
  said to throw a full repertoire of four pitches: a high-velocity fastball,
  a deadly slider, a fast curveball that would bedazzle hitters, and a
  change-up. Using Pitchf/x data*, we can see that the fastball and slider
  live up to the legend of Joba.  The curveball and change-up are where the
  legend seems to devolve into more myth than reality.

  *We only have Pitchf/x data for part of his 2007 season (Pitchf/x data was
   not released for every park, if it was implemented, in 2007), but that
   comes out to 283 pitches (counting the postseason), which is plenty to
   take a look at these pitches.

  Joba&#39;s fastball did indeed seem special.  The pitch did not have a lot of
  tail; in fact, it could be described as a straight fastball.  The pitch
  did have a good bit of &#34;rise&#34; as you might expect for a high-speed fastball.
  But it wasn&#39;t the movement that made the pitch special, it was the pitch&#39;s
  velocity: the fastball averaged a velocity of 97.0 miles per hour and broke
  into triple digits (100 or over) six times during 2007.   The pitch&#39;s
  results oddly enough weren&#39;t amazing: the pitch got a swinging strike only
  5.6% of the time (around average for a fastball) and was not a ground ball
  pitch (33% GB Rate in a very small sample size).  The pitch also was called
  for a ball 36.7% of the time, a not very good rate.  But while these results
  may seem underwhelming for the pitch&#39;s velocity, the pitch clearly served
  to setup Joba&#39;s lower speed offerings.

  In particular, it set up Joba&#39;s amazing Slider.  Clocking in at an average
  of 86.6MPH, the pitch has little horizontal movement (and not a great
  movement relative to the fastball), causing it to sometimes be confused
  with Joba&#39;s curveball (In fact, Joba&#39;s slider has been labeled an &#34;11 to 4&#34;
  pitch, mimicking curveball terminology).  The pitch doesn&#39;t have great
  drop or sink either...but it doesn&#39;t need to have much, given how much
  rise his fastball has.  Meanwhile the pitch was insane at striking batters
  out: 65.3% percent of batters who swung at the pitch WHIFFED!  This meant
  that the pitch resulted in a swinging strike 34.8% of the time, which
  would&#39;ve made the pitch the best slider at getting swinging strikes in
  the whole league,  if Joba had pitched an entire season.

  Of course, Joba was spoken of as having four pitches, and here we see some
  disappointments.  Joba threw a few curveballs (Pitchf/x cameras caught 11
  of them), which had promising velocity (78.4MPH) and movement (7.8 inches
  of horizontal movement, and 7.4 inches of drop).  The end result is that
  the pitch would appear to be an 11-5 curve, that could be an effective
  weapon. Unfortunately, in 11 pitches, it&#39;s impossible to see how effective
  the pitch is, which was never put in play (6 balls, 3 called strikes, 2
  swinging strikes).  Joba&#39;s change-up was even more scarce:  the pitch was
  only thrown 3 times at an average of 83.9MPH.  The movement on the pitch
  was odd, and it&#39;s hard to say anything about it given the limitations of
  Pitchf/x cameras at the time and the small sample size.

  All in all, Joba was really a two pitch pitcher during his period as The
  Legend; though they were really good pitches.

  However, there were some cracks starting to be shown in The Legend:
  Joba&#39;s velocity on all of his pitches seems to have dropped in his last
  few starts, as seen by Figure 1 below with the fastball:

  <a href="https://assets.sbnation.com/assets/531050/Joba07FastballVelocity.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/531050/Joba07FastballVelocity.png</a>
<div class="richcontent"><img src="https://assets.sbnation.com/assets/531050/Joba07FastballVelocity.png" alt="" loading="lazy" /></div>
<span class="f2">  Figure 1:  A graph showing the average velocity of Joba&#39;s fastball in each
</span><span class="f2">             of his appearances in 2007.  Note that Start #13 is the game
</span><span class="f2">             where he was facing a horde of angry insects, so don&#39;t take that
</span><span class="f2">             drop too seriously.</span>

  This drop in velocity was seen in all of Joba&#39;s pitches, making it seem
  like his high velocities early in the season could&#39;ve simply been a mirage
  caused by hot Pitchf/x cameras.  In other words: Joba&#39;s super fast pitches
  may have been simply the result of a hot radar gun, and part of the Legend
  may never have been truly reality.  In fact, his drop in fastball velocity
  would carry to his 2008 season, where Joba turned into The Ace:

</span><span class="f6">└─────────────────────────────────────┘</span>

  Coming into 2008, there was a lot of debate in the VERY active New York
  Sports Media (WFAN, NY Post, and NY Daily News, etc.) about whether Joba
  should return to starting or be the bridge to Mariano Rivera.  The Yankees
  opted to keep him in the bullpen to start the season, with the Yankees
  openly still claiming that Joba&#39;s future was in the starting rotation.
  Reports were that the Yankees may have planned to send Joba down mid-season
  to regain his form as a starter for the latter parts of the season.
  However, the Yankees&#39; hand regarding Joba would soon be forced, as young
  4th and 5th starters Philip Hughes and Ian Kennedy combined to go 0-8 with
  ERAs above 6.0, leaving them in desperate need of a starter.

  Of course, before this occurred, Joba spent two months in the bullpen once
  again.  As mentioned above, while Joba would perform well during this span
  (30Ks, 11BBs, 1HRs), this was not quite the legend of 2007.  Joba&#39;s fastball
  and slider velocity were both down from 2007: with Joba averaging only
  95.9MPH on his fastball and his slider averaging only 85.3MPH.  These
  numbers are more in line with those at the end of 2007 (not counting the
  Midges-game).  That said, the results of Joba&#39;s individual pitches were
  still great: his slider had over a 50% whiff rate against both righties
  and lefties and his fastball had a swinging strike rate of 13% against
  RHBs, while remaining at the same level as 2007 against LHBs.  Once again,
  the curveball was rarely seen, and the change-up showed up only four times
  (against opposite handed batters).

  But, as stated earlier, the Yankees would convert Joba to the starting
  rotation in June.  Oddly, they didn&#39;t send him down to the minors,
  preferring to convert Joba in the major leagues (resulting in starts of 2.1
  and 4.1 innings pitched to start).  Meanwhile, as Joba made 11 starts in
  June and July, the talk in the media was not of how well he was pitching,
  but of how Joba was unable to put together a single long start (partially
  due to a pitch count limit), with Joba only reaching 7 innings pitched in
  a start one time during these two months.  This was a shame really, as Joba
  was REALLY REALLY good during this stretch and in fact was quite simply
  ...an ace:

<span class="f5">  Table 1: Joba&#39;s overall results during his starts in June and July in 2008. </span>

  Meanwhile, while Joba&#39;s results were ace-like, his great stuff....remained
  great as a starter:

└─────────────────────────────────────┘

  As you can see, Joba&#39;s basic pitches basically retained the same movement
  and velocity that Joba had as a reliever to start 2008, with his fastball
  losing around a mile per hour, but still hitting a very nice 95.1 MPH
  (this number is slightly higher than it should be, due to a really hot
  fastball during Joba&#39;s second start).  The pitch retained its surprisingly
  average swinging strike rate, however.

  Meanwhile, Joba&#39;s slider continued to get near 50% whiffs on pitches swung
  at, while increasing its ground ball rate to above 60%, making the pitch
  absolutely amazing (An expected run value of -4.12 per 100 pitches...an
  astounding number).

  We finally begin to see a little bit of the change-up from Joba against
  opposite (left) handed batters, but it wasn&#39;t very effective in its very
  small sample size.  Meanwhile Joba&#39;s curveball finally appeared to be used
  at a reasonable frequency, but had disappointing results: the ground ball
  rate was nice, but the swinging strike rate was lower than what would be
  expected from an average fastball, nevertheless a breaking ball.  Still,
  Joba didn&#39;t need this pitch, given how insane his slider was.

  So yeah, Joba was finally indeed a four-pitch pitcher, and though two of
  those pitches (the change-up and curveball) were not plus pitches, the
  other two would seem to be (even if the fastball&#39;s results weren&#39;t great,
  they certainly set up his deadly slider.)

  Unfortunately, Joba would make one more start that season, a start in Texas
  on August 4th...where Joba had to leave the game in the 5th inning with
  stiffness in his pitching shoulder.  Joba would later be diagnosed with
  rotator cuff tendinitis.  This injury would end the reign of Joba
  Chamberlain, The Ace.

  Joba would of course return in September to pitch in the bullpen in 2008,
  and had pretty good results (14Ks, 3 BBs in 11.1IP).  However he would not
  be the same pitcher, as his pitch velocity was down all around, with the
  biggest drop being seen in his fastball.  Figure 2 shows the average
  fastball velocity of Joba&#39;s fastball as a reliever per each appearance
  in 2008 and it clearly shows how Joba&#39;s fastball dropped in velocity (it
  averaged only 93.9 MPH in Septemer):

  Joba would start again; in fact, he spent the entire season of 2009 as a
  starter in the Yankee rotation.  But he was clearly no longer an ace, as
  you can see from his results.  Even worse, his fastball velocity was down
  even further from the end of 2009, not even averaging 93 MPH, as you can
  see from his pitch results shown in Table 3:

  As you can see, Joba&#39;s results were down across the board.  His fastball&#39;s
  average swinging strike rate dropped to badly below average, and the pitch
  missed the zone more frequently (resulting in a greater amount of walks).
  The slider started to get less whiffs and less ground balls, making the
  pitch still a very good pitch...but dropping it&#39;s effectiveness almost in
  half (the pitch&#39;s expected run value per 100 pitches dropped from -4.12
  runs per 100 to -2.22 runs per 100).  The Curveball and change-up did seem
  to improve somewhat (the change-up finally being thrown a decent amount of
  the time), but the change-up was still below average for that pitch type
  and the curveball&#39;s swinging strike rate was still way below average.

  All in all, except for the fact that he still did have a good slider, Joba
  did not resemble Joba the Ace at all in 2009.  Feeling the Yankees did not
  need an average 5th starter, and noting that Joba DID pitch well (or at
  least had good results) after his injury in relief in 2008, the Yankees
  put him back in the bullpen in 2010.

  And Joba did recover somewhat, as you can see from table 4:

  As you can see, the velocities of all of Joba&#39;s pitches were up across the
  board; in fact, his slider clocked in at its fastest average speed EVER.
  The fastball velocity was still not up to pre-injury 2008 levels, but Mike
  Fast reported that at least at the start of September that Yankee Stadium&#39;s
  Pitchf/x velocity readings were 0.7 MPH below normal, meaning that the
  pitch&#39;s velocity is probably understated by a little (of course, this bias
  could&#39;ve existed in previous years as well, so don&#39;t read too much into
  this).  And with the improved velocity came improved results:  the
  fastball&#39;s swinging strike rate returned to its normal average rate, and
  its accuracy improved to a pre-injury rate.

  Meanwhile Joba&#39;s faster slider improved its ground ball rate while keeping
  its swinging strike rate constant.  Oddly enough, the whiff rate on this
  pitch did drop, which is a glaring sign, but the pitch was swung at more
  frequently, resulting in the same swinging strike rate as in 2009.

  And the Curve ball, which was basically non-existent when Joba was a
  reliever in 2008 finally had some reasonable results...the swinging strike
  rate increased yet again, though it was still below average for a breaking
  pitch.  Meanwhile, the change-up disappeared, as Joba doesn&#39;t seem to use
  it as a reliever.

  Now Joba&#39;s great year as a reliever was obscured by some bad luck on BABIP
  and in a bad strand rate.  Still, it would appear that post-injury, Joba
  has been able to find success as a reliever and not as a starter.  This
  would support the Yankees&#39; decision to keep Joba in the pen.

<span class="f3 hl">Joba, Going Forward:</span>

  Of course, this isn&#39;t quite so clear: Joba&#39;s pitch velocity as a reliever
  in 2010 was clearly up from it as a reliever post-injury in 2008.  This
  might indicate that Chamberlain might deserve another shot at starting,
  as he may have recovered somewhat from the injury or at least his arm may
  be stronger now than it was in 2009, the year immediately following the
  injury.  In fact, this may be the case, given that Joba&#39;s pitches did seem
  to increase in velocity over the course of 2010.  If that&#39;s the case, Joba
  may be able to find a place in the starting rotation as a pitcher who is
  not quite The Ace, but is not quite as bad as the mediocre starter of 2009,
  either.  With the other choice for a fifth starter being Sergio Mitre
  (and a bullpen solidified by the addition of Rafael Soriano), the Yankees
  may want to try this.

  But Brian Cashman has said no, as he thinks that the injury in Texas has
  forever changed Joba so that he&#39;s not worth starting.  And, you know, he
  could be right...clearly Joba&#39;s results as a starter post-injury have been
  much worse than his results as a reliever.  Certainly, one would expect
  another good year from Joba in the pen next year, whereas his results
  in the starting rotation would be near impossible to project.

  Yet, this seems like a risk that would be worthwhile for the Yankees to
  take, given their available options.  And it would certainly seem like one
  that could be beneficial for Joba to figure out what pitcher he truly is.

  Joba, the Legend is certainly gone.  Joba, the Ace is almost certainly gone.
  But Joba may in fact be better than Joba, the Reliever.  I would think it&#39;s
  time for the Yankees to give Joba a chance to find a fourth version of
  himself and see if the 25 year old former top-prospect can become Joba,
  the Solid Starter, a guy who can give them a big boost in the tough AL East.
