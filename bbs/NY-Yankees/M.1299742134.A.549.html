A fan first, Banuelos living a dream
<span class="hl">頭號洋基迷，Banuelos正在實現自己的夢想</span>

Highly regarded left-hander proud to be closing in on Bronx
<span class="hl">被高度期待的左投新秀於Bronx的精采登板</span>


TAMPA, Fla. -- Manny Banuelos had just completed his work for the evening on
Wednesday, moving briskly across the clubhouse carpet before he glanced at
his locker and exhaled deeply. It was time to contact home.
<span class="hl">來了！來了！從更衣室輕輕地走出來了。
</span><span class="hl">Banuelos剛完成了他今晚的比賽，正準備打電話回家。</span>


The left-hander picked up his glowing cell phone and relayed the details of
his two innings against the Pirates&#39; lineup, keeping relatives and loved ones
at home in Mexico up to date on his progress.
<span class="hl">這位左投手滔滔不絕的把他今晚的表現轉述給家人。</span>


&#34;They can&#39;t believe this,&#34; Banuelos said, a confident smile spilling widely
across his young face. &#34;My friends and family, they can&#39;t believe I am with
the Major League players.&#34;
<span class="hl">「我的家人不會相信的，我身旁全是大聯盟的選手！」
</span><span class="hl">Banuelos自信的笑道。</span>


Yes, Banuelos is stashing his belongings in the Yankees&#39; clubhouse -- if he
looks over his right shoulder, he can make eye contact with Derek Jeter; if
he turns his head to the left, he&#39;ll likely see Mariano Rivera holding court.
<span class="hl">沒錯，如果此刻Banuelos轉頭一看，會發現隊長正朝他陰陰的笑，
</span><span class="hl">而後頭不遠處MO也還在球場上。</span>


But Banuelos&#39; first Spring Training with the Yankees goes well beyond the
normal rookie experiences, picking up a few innings here and there and
enjoying big league meal money before inevitably being sent back to Minor
League camp.
<span class="hl">你很難想像Banuelos在春訓的表現是如此傑出，遠超過多數的新秀
</span><span class="hl">，似乎在大聯盟的比賽對他而言是一種享受。</span>


Still days shy of his 20th birthday, Banuelos is not only hanging with the
big leaguers, but he&#39;s making a convincing case that he will be ready to
compete and succeed against them with consistency -- if not now, then in the
very near future.
<span class="hl">年僅20歲，卻不只是上來觀光而已，就算不是現在也絕不會拖太久
</span><span class="hl">，Banuelos的表現證明自己已經準備好了。</span>


&#34;From looking at him where I&#39;m standing, it doesn&#39;t look like he has any
fear,&#34; Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. &#34;He&#39;s aggressive, he has confidence
in his offspeed stuff that he can throw it behind in the count and he doesn&#39;t
nibble. He goes right at hitters.&#34;
<span class="hl">「在我的觀察來看，他似乎毫不畏懼而且很有自信，敢於在任何時
</span><span class="hl">候投變化球，對付打者很有一套。」喬拉帝如是說。</span>


Banuelos has made people notice his first three Grapefruit League outings. He
debuted with a perfect frame against the Tigers on Feb. 28, freezing Jhonny
Peralta and Brandon Inge for called third strikes, then raised the stakes
with two scoreless innings against the Red Sox on March 4.
<span class="hl">世人在Banuelos的前三場春訓比賽就注意到這位新秀。2/28投出了完美的
</span><span class="hl">初登板，3/4對紅襪兩局無失分。</span>


In that game, Banuelos struck out three, including another proven big leaguer
in Jason Varitek. Back home in Durango, Mexico, Banuelos said that his
mother, grandmother, uncles and cousins were all huddled around a computer
screen with an Internet connection, cheering every pitch.
<span class="hl">那場比賽裡，他送給了包含Varitek在內的打者共三K。Banuelos的
</span><span class="hl">家人親戚通通擠在螢幕前為他所投的每一球喝采。</span>


&#34;It was unbelievable,&#34; Banuelos said. &#34;They were so happy because they saw
Jeter and [Alex] Rodriguez behind me.&#34;
<span class="hl">「真是令人不敢置信，當他們看到隊長跟阿肉就站在我身邊時簡直
</span><span class="hl">要瘋了。」</span>

Banuelos said that, growing up in Mexico, the Yankees were ever-present. He
shyly admits that Jeter was his favorite player, and says that he has hung on
Rivera&#39;s every action this spring, hoping to heed the closer&#39;s sage advice.
<span class="hl">在墨西哥，洋基隊永遠是那至高無上的存在，Banuelos害羞的說出
</span><span class="hl">隊長是他的最愛(..)。而他老是不由自主的望著MO的每一個動作，
</span><span class="hl">希望自己能牢牢記住前輩所有的建議。</span>


&#34;When I was a little kid, you always heard about the Yankees,&#34; Banuelos said.
&#34;The best team in the world. My family, we are Yankees fans, too. Now I talk
with them. This is my team. I&#39;m a Yankees fan, so I love all these players.&#34;
<span class="hl">「我從小就看他們的比賽，我的家人也都是洋基迷，他們是世界上
</span><span class="hl">最棒的球隊，而我現在是其中一員，我愛他們。」</span>


And the Yankees are high on Banuelos. This was the reason for having him come
to Spring Training along with other touted hurlers like right-hander Dellin
Betances, so they could mingle and get tastes of what could be around the
bend.
<span class="hl">洋基隊也確實很重視Banuelos。這也是為什麼他們會將Banuelos送
</span><span class="hl">來大聯盟和其他潛力新秀如Betances一起春訓，期待他們能夠互相
</span><span class="hl">激盪出一些火花。</span>


&#34;This is his first big league camp and he&#39;s doing really well,&#34; Cashman said
of Banuelos. &#34;What we wanted from Betances and Banuelos especially, along
with some of these other guys, it&#39;s all right to get your feet wet and get
the experience of being in a Major League locker room, having [reporters] ask
them questions, performing in front of 12,000 people, on TV.
<span class="hl">「這是他第一次的大聯盟春訓而他也的確表現傑出，我們所期望的
</span><span class="hl">就是讓這些新秀有所體驗，在12000人面前投球，被記者訪問，在電
</span><span class="hl">是上被觀看。」現金人如此評論。</span>


&#34;The evaluations of them haven&#39;t changed. It&#39;s just that they&#39;ll leave camp
here more experienced, more battle tested, more prepared. And it will serve
them better down the line.&#34;
<span class="hl">「對於他們的評價不會改變，在這所經歷的一切是為了讓他們更好。」</span>


Cashman has said that no matter what Banuelos does this spring, he is
ticketed to begin the year at Double-A Trenton, having &#34;no chance&#34; to change
minds and advance to the big leagues.
<span class="hl">對於Banuelos的規劃也不會因為他的表現而有所改變，仍然是從二A起步。</span>


The reset button will be pushed, flushing his 0.00 ERA in three appearances
during which the lefty has struck out eight and walked one in five innings.
But even if those stats are deleted, the impressions should last a while.
<span class="hl">他的0.00防禦率、五局裡的八次三振都將歸零，但令人驚艷的印象相
</span><span class="hl">信會持續一陣子。</span>


&#34;He is a nice left-handed arm,&#34; Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild said.
&#34;He&#39;s a kid with a good look. He&#39;s able to repeat his delivery very well and
does things pretty easily. He&#39;s someone that should have a good future here.
He&#39;s a young kid that&#39;s got to go through all the steps to get here.&#34;
<span class="hl">「他是個很好的左投，年輕又帥氣，能夠流暢的投出每一球。我相信
</span><span class="hl">會有很好的未來，有資格通過一切考驗踏上這裡。」投教表示。</span>


Of course, Banuelos has heard that talk. While he remains hopeful of
dominating to the point where he can&#39;t be ignored, he understands that the
organization has his best interests in mind.
<span class="hl">當然Banuelos也聽說了這些評論。雖然他還是希望自己能夠藉由這些
</span><span class="hl">表現讓自己不被忽略，不過他能了解球隊的安排。</span>


&#34;I want to get to the Major Leagues soon,&#34; Banuelos said. &#34;It&#39;s OK if they
want to send me to Trenton. I just want to stay here. I don&#39;t want to go
down. But if they send me down, I want to go up quickly.&#34;
<span class="hl">「我想要快點上到major，當然如果球隊要我回去小聯盟我也可以理
</span><span class="hl">解，但我想待在這，如果他們真的送我下去，我一定會盡快回來。」</span>


With a grin and a soft voice, Banuelos acknowledges that he feels he is ready
for the challenge of staring down big league hitters on a nightly basis. The
Yankees will continue to test him this spring, but Banuelos believes he can
see Yankee Stadium in his very near future.
<span class="hl">Banuelos平靜的表達出自己的想法，認為自己已經可以對付大聯盟的
</span><span class="hl">打者了，而洋基在今年春天會持續的測試他，Banuelos相信自己很快
</span><span class="hl">可以來到Stadium球場。</span>


&#34;I feel like that,&#34; Banuelos said. &#34;Soon, I promise.&#34;
<span class="hl">我有預感，等著吧！</span>
