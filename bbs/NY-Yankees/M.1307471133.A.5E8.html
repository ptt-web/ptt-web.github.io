3rd Round 118Pick RHP Jordan Cote

<a href="http://www.yankeesdaily.com/post/24288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://www.yankeesdaily.com/post/24288</a>

With their pick in the third round (118th overall), the New York Yankees have
selected Winnisquam Regional (N.H.) righthander Jordan Cote.
The 6-foot-6, 215-pounder is currently committed to Coastal Carolina, but is
reportedly very signable. In Sunday’s profile of the prospect on
ESPNBoston.com, he told correspondent Roger Brown “Money is definitely the
No. 1 factor. I wish baseball could always be for fun, but that’s not the
way it is.”

ESPN’s Keith Law has Cote ranked No. 85 on his Top 100, with the following
scouting report:

Cote is an extremely tall right-hander with present arm strength, and he’s a
virtual blank slate as a pitcher, having received limited instruction. His
physical tools are a pitching coach’s dream.

The New Hampshire native has been mostly 88-92 in cold weather all spring,
with fringy off-speed stuff, mostly a mid-70s curveball that he needs to get
on top of better. His mechanics need a cleanup, if not an overhaul; among
other things he tends to get his back elbow up during his delivery, pinching
his shoulders behind him and putting pressure on both joints.

He also might slide because like most New Hampshire kids, he’s tough to
scout between weather, short schedule, and poor competition. But he’s pretty
athletic and has very little pitching experience, so it’s all projection
with lots for a player development group to work with.

Last weekend, an American League scout gave me the following scouting report
on Cote:

“He’s the one that’s been climbing the most. I’d say Cote was one that
was kind of a sleeper early in the season. People had to wait and see what
you get out of him, being in a Northern climate, playing on 35-degree days
more so than Mass kids. Early on, he struggled, was hitting 87-88, then over
the last two or three weeks, as the weather warmed up he found his groove. He
’s really climbed into the upper echelon of high school prospects. You look
at that frame, 6-6, 215, and there’s a lot of projectability. You could see
him filling out to 240, and see that fastball velocity increase because of
the hand speed he demonstrates.”
