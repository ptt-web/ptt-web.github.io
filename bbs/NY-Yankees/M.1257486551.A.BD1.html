Girardi helps woman in car crash after winning World Series
By JUSTIN TERRANOVA

After leading the Yankees to their 27th World Championship, Joe Girardi’s
night was far from over.

The Yankees manager was driving home from The Bronx early this morning
when he pulled over to help a female motorist who crashed into a wall on
the Cross County Parkway in Eastchester, according to LoHud.com.

“The guy wins the World Series, what does he do? He stops to help,&#34;
Westchester County police officer Kathleen Cristiano, who was among the
first to arrive at the accident scene, told The Journal News. &#34;It was
totally surreal.&#34;

Girardi explained his role today on WFAN. He said he was driving in the
right lane and saw the car in the left lane around a bend. He crossed the
street to the car and where the driver, Marie Henry, was already on the
phone with police.

&#34;I ran across the street, because as bad as the car had looked I was
really concerned,&#34; Girardi said.

Girardi said the police arrived within 3-4 minutes, and he went back to
his car to take his family home. He said Henry had no idea who he was.

&#34;She didn&#39;t find out from me,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;She probably found out about
it on the news today.&#34;

Cristiano was one of officers at an intoxication checkpoint and saw Girardi
pass by her 15 minutes before the incident. Andy Pettitte, who was the
winning pitcher in last night’s 7-3 win over the Phillies, also had
passed by.

&#34;He was jumping up and down, trying to flag me down,&#34; Cristiano, a Yankees
fan, said. &#34;You don&#39;t expect him standing by a car accident trying to
help.&#34;

Henry was able to get out of the car by the time officers arrived and
declined a trip to the hospital.

According to LoHud it is a dangerous part of the road where the highway
expands to three lanes on each side and traffic routinely buzzes by at
high speeds.

&#34;He could have gotten killed,&#34; county Sgt. Thomas McGurn said, adding
that responding police units take extra precaution in that area because
of the blind curve and speeding cars. &#34;Traffic goes by at 80 mph.&#34;

That did not stop Girardi.

&#34;The important thing is, obviously there&#39;s a lot of joy in what we do,
but we can&#39;t forget to be human beings where we help others out,&#34; Girardi
said. &#34;I think that&#39;s the most important thing we can do in life.&#34;
