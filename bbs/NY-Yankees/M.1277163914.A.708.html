The Yankees have announced that they have called minor league outfielder
Colin Curtis up from Triple-A Scranton. There is no word yet on exactly whom
Curtis will be replacing on the roster.

Curtis, 25, has played 35 games at the Triple-A level this season. In those
games he has 125 at bats, a .280 average, .357 OBP, .368 SLG, and a .725 OPS.
He split 2009 between Double-A and Triple-A. In 132 games last season he had
a combined .250 average, .321 OBP, and a .686 OPS.

He’s always been considered a solid, but unspectacular prospect because he
is a very average player in many respects. He’s got a bat that has played at
every level, but was not outstanding anywhere and he has never displayed much
pop. He plays defense at all three outfield spots, but has both an average
arm and range. He doesn’t steal bases, but isn’t station to station.

He’s really very average so it will be interesting to see if he sticks at
the major league level. He isn’t likely to be a starting outfielder even on
weak teams, but it is certainly possible that he could be a serviceable
fourth outfielder.

There is no corresponding move yet. The most likely move will be to demote
outfielder Chad Huffman or catcher Chad Moeller. Curtis doesn’t have a spot
on the 40-man roster though and that might mean that Moeller is the one who
is getting DFA’d to make room on the roster. That’s just speculation right
now, we’ll update you when the Yankees make an official move.

Updated: Chad Moeller will be the one sent down. Since he doesn’t have
options left he’s going to have to clear waivers to stay within the Yankees
organization.
