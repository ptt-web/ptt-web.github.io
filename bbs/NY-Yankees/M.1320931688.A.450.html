Yankees interested in pitcher from Japan (no, not that one)
By Eric Schultz On November 9, 2011

Presumably the Yankees are still considering a bid on Yu Darvish
should the Nippon Ham Fighters post him (as expected), but in this
post I’m going to look at a guy in the Japanese League who is a
bit more under the radar, and won’t require a large posting fee.
Wei-Ying Chen is a 26 year-old, 6’0〃176 pound left-handed pitcher
for the Chiunchi Dragons.  Chen is actually Taiwanese, but signed
as an amateur free agent in Japan out of high school. Unlike Darvish,
Chen will be a free agent this offseason, allowing him to sign with
a big league team without going through the posting process. This
gives him the ability to pick the team he wants, and also allows
teams to bid for his services without paying a posting fee.  Chen
has apparently been interested in going to America for several years,
but the team has not posted him.

A lot of the information about Chen, and the Yankees’ interest in him,
came courtesy of David P of Yankee Source (@yankeesource on Twitter),
who was kind enough to share his thoughts on Chen with me via Twitter
(and if you remember, wrote this great guest post on Darvish for us
recently).  Per David, Chen can bring the heat, throwing a fastball
in the low-90′s (topping out at 95), and complementing it with a
slider (his best secondary offering), a curve, and a forkball.
His velocity was down a little this year due to a leg injury
(topping out around 91), but it did not seem to affect him, as his
level of performance was similar to previous seasons.

In Chen’s career with the Dragons, he has gone 36-30 with a 2.59 ERA,
7.2 k/9, and 2.2 bb/9.  His best season was in 2009, when he led the
league in ERA with a gaudy 1.54 (league average was 3.55)  By those
stats he has been able to miss bats, but is not a major strikeout
pitcher (though his control is very good).  Unlike some other pitchers
in the Japanese League (such as Darvish), Chen has not had incredibly
high workloads, with his highest inning total 188 in 2010.

You can see video of Chen pitching here (courtesy of Patrick of
Fangraphs), which is a 2-hour clip from a Dragons-Yomiuri Giants
game.  I am no expert on mechanics, but from the few minutes I
watched Chen’s delivery it looks pretty clean and smooth, and he
doesn’t seem to rely too much on deception. He uses a three-quarters
arm angle, which could help make him tough on lefties.   Chen is
somewhat of a flyball pitcher, however, which may not work
so well in Yankee Stadium.

The Yankees reportedly have interest in Chen as a reliever (I imagine
his fastball would play up nicely in the ‘pen), though thus far it
is unclear whether Chen views himself as a starter in the bigs (and
more importantly, whether any other big league teams view him as one).
I have no idea of Chen’s contract demands, but I assume he would be
a fairly affordable signing.  I wouldn’t support guaranteeing Chen
a rotation spot (since we saw how well that worked with Kei Igawa),
but if the Yankees think he can start, I would be happy to have him
compete for the 5th starter spot (provided he is willing to go to AAA
or the bullpen if he doesn’t win the job).

Chen is no Darvish as far as talent goes, but the fact that the Yankees
are looking at him has piqued my interest.  They may just be doing
their homework on him as they would with a typical international free
agent, or there may be a deeper interest there.  It’s unclear whether
that interest is mutual, though the Yankees remain popular in Japan,
which could help them bring in Chen.  The contract Chen ends up with
will likely depend on whether he is viewed as a starter or reliever.
Either way, the Yankees can afford him, but as always, the question
will be whether he is worth the money.  The velocity drop is a bit
of a red flag (though I would imagine that even when healthy he was
never hitting 95 consistently), but I’m sure the Yankees take all of
this into account.
