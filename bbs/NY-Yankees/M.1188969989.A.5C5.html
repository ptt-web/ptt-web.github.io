Yanks Unleash 20-Hit Barrage on Mariners
By TYLER KEPNER

The Yankees sent 12 hitters to the plate and scored seven runs in the
seventh inning last night. The Seattle Mariners changed pitchers twice
in the inning. That meant a lot of time sitting on the bench for the
Yankees’ No. 1 starter, Chien-Ming Wang.

But with a 10-run lead, the Yankees still sent Wang to the mound to work
the eighth in a 12-3 victory at Yankee Stadium. He needed 11 warm-up
pitches to get loose, and his first pitch puttered in at 89 miles an
hour.

“That’s almost a changeup for him,” the pitching coach, Ron Guidry,
said.

After Jeremy Reed grounded out on the next pitch, Guidry sprang from the
dugout to meet with Wang on the mound. Catcher Jorge Posada became Wang
’s protector.

“I was not going to let him pitch,” said Posada, who homered twice.
“The two pitches he threw, something about it just didn’t look right.
He told me he felt tight.”

A few hours after Roger Clemens announced that he would get a cortisone
shot for his inflamed right elbow, Wang left the game with stiffness in
his lower back. Wang has six days off before his next start, Tuesday in
Toronto, and he said he was not worried about making it.

Wang’s injury was not the only one the Yankees sustained while piling
up 20 hits and restoring their two-game lead over Seattle in the
American League wild-card race. Alex Rodriguez who sent his 46th home
run of the season roughly 10 rows into the third deck in left field in
the sixth inning, hurt his right ankle while sliding into third base in
the seventh inning.

Mariners third baseman Adrián Beltre landed on Rodriguez, whose X-rays
came back negative. Rodriguez said his ankle was swollen.

“It was a little scary,” he said. “But let’s see how it feels in the
morning. It feels a little sore right now.”

A crowd of 52,487 — plus another frisky squirrel perched atop the right
field foul pole — watched Bobby Abreu, Robinson Canó and Posada
collect four hits apiece to lift Wang to his 17th victory, tied with
Boston’s Josh Beckett for the most in the majors.

Wang allowed a run and five hits over seven and a third innings, getting
grounders for his first six outs and inducing double-play grounders to
end the fifth, sixth and seventh innings.

Before Beltre’s homer in the seventh, the closest Seattle came to
scoring was when Hideki Matsui threw out Beltre at the plate in the
fifth. Posada deftly gathered a short hop, shifted his position and
tagged Beltre’s foot just in time.

The Yankees’ barrage in the bottom of the seventh made it 11-1 and
encouraged Seattle to empty its crowded bench. The Mariners, who have 35
active players, used 18 position players and 6 pitchers in the game.

The Yankees stuck with Wang, who had thrown only 84 pitches. Manager Joe
Torre said he was not worried that the long inning would affect Wang
because Guidry had checked with him before the eighth.

“He’s not going to pitch until a week from today in Toronto,” Torre
said. “He had a low pitch count, and he talked to him a couple of times
during the inning and Wang didn’t think it was going to be an issue.”

Wang (17-6) said he had never had a back problem before, but nobody
seemed worried that the discomfort would linger, especially with the
long layoff awaiting him.

“He’s got plenty enough time to get ready,” Guidry said.

The Yankees had better hope so, because beyond Wang and Andy Pettitte,
their rotation is shaky. The rookie Phil Hughes, who pitches tonight,
has won only once in six starts since coming off the disabled list.

Hughes was optimistic yesterday because the Class AAA pitching coach
Dave Eiland, who tutored him in the minors, supervised his past two
bullpen sessions. Hughes said they worked on smoothing his mechanics by
not rushing his delivery.

Coaches have encouraged Hughes to use all his pitches and attack the
strike zone. Hughes has been too predictable for hitters because he has
not thrown enough changeups, the pitch that helped him hold the Texas
Rangers without a hit into the seventh inning May 1.

“It’s not my second-best pitch or even my third-best, but it’s a
pitch I definitely need to show,” Hughes said. “It’s not a
swing-and-miss pitch, but it’s a pitch to get them off my fastball. In
Texas, I threw three in the first inning, and that set the tempo. They
weren’t really able to sit on one pitch.

“It’s something I’ll concentrate on, but the No. 1 thing is strike
one. After that, I can kind of play around a little bit.”

If Hughes can come even close to the sharpness he showed in Texas, the
Yankees will gladly take it.
