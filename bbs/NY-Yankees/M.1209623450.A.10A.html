Yankees place Hughes on 15-day DL
Team announces right-hander has strained right oblique

By Bryan Hoch / MLB.com

NEW YORK -- The way Phil Hughes had been pitching of late, the Yankees&#39;
right-hander was likely to find himself back in the Minor Leagues for a
refresher course. It just so worked out that he&#39;ll instead eventually pitch
there on a rehabilitation assignment.

The Yankees placed Hughes on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right
oblique on Wednesday, making the announcement during the club&#39;s 6-2 loss to
the Tigers. Hughes, the youngest pitcher in the Major Leagues at 21, took a
pounding in the Yankees&#39; defeat to the Tigers at Yankee Stadium one day
earlier.

&#34;Either way, he&#39;s going to need to get some work in,&#34; Yankees general manager
Brian Cashman said. &#34;Either way, he probably needs the time now, so he&#39;s
going to get it. Unfortunately it&#39;s going to be sitting on our disabled
list.&#34;

Hughes said he first felt the strain, characterized by the club as &#34;mild,&#34;
faintly after his aborted start on April 24 at Chicago, when he hurled two
scoreless innings but did not return following a rain delay. He will be sent
for a MRI in New York on Thursday.

&#34;It&#39;s frustrating, but I&#39;ve just got to deal with it,&#34; Hughes said. &#34;There&#39;s
not much else I can do. Things are not going so well right now and add this
on top of it, it&#39;s just frustrating.&#34;

While he said his side sessions between starts were not affected, Hughes was
rapped for six runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings on Tuesday by Detroit,
after which point he mentioned the injury to the club&#39;s training staff.

Yankees manager Joe Girardi said that he watched game tape of Hughes&#39; start
after learning of the injury and spotted a point in the fourth inning where
Hughes sat on the bench, let out a deep breath and appeared to wince. Girardi
said that he did not believe Hughes&#39; performance had been affected since the
club&#39;s radar gun had him touching 94 mph on Tuesday.

&#34;Physically, he&#39;s looked great to me, so I was shocked when I heard it from
the trainers,&#34; Girardi said.

Cashman said that the Yankees expect Hughes&#39; recovery process to take more
than 15 days, with a Minor League rehabilitation assignment necessary at some
point.

As a point of comparison, Yankees outfielder Bobby Abreu suffered an oblique
strain in Spring Training last year and did not come out of an offensive funk
until June, and the team wants to be arguably even more careful with Hughes,
whom they view as a prized prospect.

&#34;You&#39;ve got to make sure with the torque he has and the twisting he does,
that he doesn&#39;t feel it at all,&#34; Girardi said.

Hughes, 0-4 with a 9.00 ERA in six starts this month, was next scheduled to
start against the Mariners on Sunday, but said that the time off may do him
well. He said the injury feels like a &#34;dull pinch.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve got to sit and wait anyway, so hopefully I can clear my head of all the
negative stuff that&#39;s going on,&#34; Hughes said.

Cashman said that Sunday&#39;s start will instead go to right-hander Darrell
Rasner, who is 4-0 with a 0.87 ERA and was named the International League&#39;s
pitcher of the week for the period of April 21-27.

&#34;The guy who&#39;s pitching the best down there is Darrell Rasner, so that&#39;s the
guy we&#39;re going to tap,&#34; Cashman said.

Rasner was in Spring Training with New York as a non-roster invitee and
narrowly missed making the Opening Day roster as a long reliever.

Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte said that the disabled list assignment
could be a &#34;blessing in disguise&#34; for Hughes, who also missed a good chunk of
last season with a strained left hamstring suffered on May 1 and a sprained
left ankle he turned while performing conditioning exercises in Tampa, Fla.,
on May 25.

&#34;He&#39;s just got to make the best of it and get it healthy, and try to get his
stuff together,&#34; Pettitte said.
