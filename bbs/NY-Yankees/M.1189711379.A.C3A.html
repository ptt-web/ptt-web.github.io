NEW YORK (WCBS 880)  -- Brian Cashman, Senior Vice-President and General
Manager of the New York Yankees,  was kind enough to spend some time with
me detailing the organization’s commitment to securing and nurturing young
pitching talent. In addition to discussing the progress of many youngsters,
including Joba Chamberlain, Humberto Sanchez and Ross Ohlendorf, Cashman
fielded my questions about Kei Igawa, Mike Mussina, and other topics--
including whether the organization would consider a positional move for
Derek Jeter, and, oh ya, that A-Rod opt-out thing.

感謝現金人慷慨撥冗接受訪談，讓我們問以下這些問題...blablabla....開場白，跳過

<span class="f6 hl">Brian, I can’t remember the last time the Yanks have had so many young
</span><span class="f6 hl">promising arms in their system. What do you and your scouting staff look
</span><span class="f6 hl">for when drafting or trading for young pitchers?</span>

Essentially high ceiling talent...I think that there was a period where we
kind of forgot the most important aspect of the organization is development.
We were so focused on the major league situation. Two years ago we basically
simplified things and recognized that our business is baseball and the
foundation has to come from within. Our amateur people went out with renewed
spirit and determination based on us telling them that “Hey...we are going
in this direction. We need you to be good at this. We will protect our draft
choices and we will compete with anybody for talent.”

I think that the system has been restocked to some degree but that can’t
stop now. We have to keep it going. But we are going to be aggressive with
high-ceiling, high-talent players. We have been in the past conservative,
but I definitely want to change that focus and work to enjoy the fruits of
that labor.

<span class="f6 hl">問題一：Brain，我想不起來上一次洋基系統裡有這麼多令人期待的好投手是哪時候耶，
</span><span class="f6 hl">        你和你的球探在選秀或交易的時候是怎麼找的呀？</span>
現金人：基本上就是高資質、潛能（high ceiling talent) ....我想，我們曾有個時期
        忘記了球團最重要的一個面向就是未來的發展，那時只注意大聯盟的戰況。兩年
        前，我們開始從根本上把事情單純化，認清我們的事業是在棒球，所有的基礎都
        來自於此。我們出去的球探會帶著新的想法和新的決策模式，而這些嶄新的改變
        建諸於我們跟他們說的：「嘿..我們要往這方向走，希望你們也能精於這走向，
        我們會保護我們的選秀，會去培養有潛力的選手。」
        我想我們整個系統已經更新到某個程度了，但是並不能現在就停擺，必須繼續進
        行。我們會繼續積極地尋找培養高資質、高才能的球員。過去我們是比較保守，
        但我明確地改變了工作的重點，如此才能享受努力後的成果。


<span class="f6 hl">You’re not afraid to take risks if there is a high-ceiling pitcher out there
</span><span class="f6 hl">with arm problems and you can’t worry if it doesn’t work out.</span>

That’s correct. There are two players that the jury is out on but are
examples. Andrew Brackman, NC State, 6’ 10”, right-handed starter who
eventually wound up having Tommy John surgery here. We knew going into the
draft that he had some elbow problems; we were picking 30th in the 1st round.
But the difference in the talent at the back of the first round compared to
the front of the round was pretty significant in our evaluation. Andrew
Brackman healthy would have been a top 5 pick. In the first round, Andrew
Brackman with an elbow issue fell to 30. Therefore, we asked ourselves would
we rather have the high-ceiling of someone with an elbow injury that
historically can be successfully corrected? Or should we go with a more
conservative pick, someone with considerably lesser talent, not as high of
a ceiling but healthy….we went for Door # 1.

And the same thing with the Gary Sheffield trade. We acquired Humberto
Sanchez and we knew we were getting someone with an elbow issue who might
need Tommy John surgery. But the type of ability Sanchez has you can’t find
unless you give up a Gary Sheffield type. So again we went with the
high-ceiling type. We will find out over time if these decisions will work
out for us but those are some examples of our aggressiveness, going for the
higher talent.

<span class="f6 hl">問題二：選擇一位高資質卻可能有手臂傷病的投手，你不怕有風險？你不擔心最後可能
</span><span class="f6 hl">        沒結果？</span>
現金人：你說的沒錯。有兩個例子可以來談談。Andrew Brackman，北卡州人，6呎10吋
        的右投先發，再來會接受T.J.手術。選秀時我們知道他有手肘問題，但我們還
        是在第一輪30順位挑選了他。跟同一輪其他順位在前的選秀球員相比，我們評
        估他更具有天分潛能，這是最重要的一點。如果Brackman健康的話，他一定排
        名前五，但因為手肘問題，所以他掉到第三十。也就是這樣，我們自問：寧可
        選擇具有高資質潛能、目前有肘傷但能治癒成功的選手，還是要保守點，去選
        資質較差未來發展沒那麼看好但健健康康的選手？我們選擇第一個。

        同樣的情況也發生在雨刷伯交易案中。我們在那樁交易獲得Humberto Sanchez
        我們也瞭解他手肘有傷病可能得進行T.J.手術。但除非你肯放掉雨刷伯，不然
        你沒辦法找到像Sanchez這類才能的選手，所以我們最後還是選擇具有高潛能
        的選項。隨著時間過去，會發現我們的決定是否正確，而這些是我們積極尋求
        高資質潛能選手的例子。


<span class="f6 hl">What is Humberto Sanchez’s prognosis for next year? Will he be pitching by
</span><span class="f6 hl">Spring Training?</span>

That’s our expectation. His surgery was in Mid-May. It was successful. He’s
throwing now. He’s got great range of motion. Eventually, he will graduate
to a half-mound and full-mound with all his assortment of pitches. Hopefully
that rehabilitation process will take him through Spring Training and the
first year he should be fine. His command may be off because that’s the
history of Tommy John, and then in Year Two as long as he stays healthy and
there are no new issues you should see the full assortment of what his
abilities can show. But we’ll see. There are two option years remaining in
his contract, before he is out of options at the big league level. Again,
he’s a big strong, 6’5” guy with a power arm, power curve, a local guy.

People forget he was the talk of last year’s Future’s game. He led all the
Starters in the Eastern league in Strikeouts per 9, even ahead of Phil
Hughes. He does possess a great deal of ability so hopefully we will get
him healthy and he will continue his journey in his development. He’s not
a finished product yet. At some point, whether it’s as a starter or a
reliever, he will impact the Yankees going forward. Obviously, you can’t
have too many pitchers.

<span class="f6 hl">問題三：Humberto Sanchez術後恢復狀況怎樣？他會在明年春訓上場投球嗎？</span>
現金人：這是我們期盼。他5 月中手術，手術很成功，現在已經在練投了。已經可以作較
        大的動作。再來他會逐步從一半高度的投手丘到標準高度的投手丘，來練習他各
        式各樣的球路。希望他的復健可以讓他加入春訓，術後第一年應該就可康復。他
        的控球應該會比較差點，T.J.手術都是這樣，然後一直保持健康的話，第二年你
        就可看到他展現他那多樣式的球路才能。在他合約中，還剩下兩次選擇權。再說
        一次，他是一位6呎5吋的強壯小子，有著強力的臂膀和很威的曲球。

        大家都忘記他曾是去年未來明星賽最熱門的話題，他在東方聯盟先發投手中，是
        K9榜上第一，甚至排在Phil Hughes 之前。他很有才華，所以我們很希望他能健
        康並且持續做好復健。從某個觀點來說，不論他是個先發或後援，他對洋基都會
        有很大助益，很明顯，投手不嫌多。


<span class="f6 hl">Ross Ohlendorf, have you been happy with his progress this year?</span>

It’s been a learning curve for both of us. Ross is a Princeton Graduate.
Our expectation was that he could be a 4th guy in the rotation or worse case
scenario he can be a nice power arm out of the pen. Here in the 2nd half when
we saw the need to improve our bullpen from within, we moved Joba Chamberlin
and Ohlendorf to the pen to try to assess them as candidates, amongst others
like Edwar Ramirez. Ross did much better for us out of the bullpen and that
may very well be where he remains. He’ll make his major league debut for us
out of the pen at some point as he just joined our 40-man roster. He picked
up some velocity coming out of the pen. He’s at 92-97 mph, power sinker,
he’s developed his slider. We have a high hopes that he can be a positive
contributor for us, most likely for the major league club out of the bullpen.

<span class="f6 hl">問題四：對 Ross Ohlendorf 今年的進展你很開心吧？</span>
現金人：這對我跟他來說都是個學習過程。Ross是普林斯頓畢業生。我們的期望是他能
        擔任先發輪值中的第四位，最差也要是個牛棚中的強力救援。季中的時候，我
        們看到我們的牛棚亟需改善，所以我們把他跟張伯倫移到牛棚，跟其他牛棚投
        手像Ramirez 一起作個評估。就我們來看Ross在牛棚表現比較好，他現在已進
        入40人名單，可能在某個時刻他就會以救援身份在大聯盟初登板。他提升牛棚
        的球速，他有92到97 mph的球速，強力伸卡，而且現在還繼續在琢磨他的滑球
        。我們很希望他能有正面的貢獻，尤其是對大聯盟的牛棚。


<span class="f6 hl">The rapid ascent of Joba Chamberlain has to be a surprise to you and everyone
</span><span class="f6 hl">in Baseball.</span>

When you have a great deal of ability and it comes together, you can move fast.
No one would have thought he’d be doing this in ’07 – same as Ian Kennedy --
  but sometimes players move themselves ahead of their developmental program.
In these two cases they have. Joba Chamberlain has been a huge stabilizing
impact on our bullpen. The Joba rules have also contributed to the fact that
 – since there are days he can’t be used – it forces a situation where
others have to be used, because there are no other choices, to be quite
honest.  This has helped Kyle Farnsworth, whose 10 of his last 11 appearances
have been shut out baseball, and Edwar Ramirez has done very well. Now the
work load is spread evenly throughout the bullpen. That might not be the case
if Joba were available more often.

And this is to protect Joba in a role he isn’t accustomed to.  I know that
some people in the media have been saying that this is my way of protecting
Joba from the manager.  Nothing is further from the truth. This is about
protecting a young pitcher at the end of his inning limit who has never been
a reliever before. And we relied on Nardi Contreras to develop a program that
would protect him.  When I realized that we weren’t going to secure any
outside help -- I didn’t want to give up the farm system -- we started to
prepare him for the bullpen and his graduation to the big leagues and he has
been spectacular.

<span class="f6 hl">問題五：Joba的竄升對你或棒球界的每個人都是個驚喜吧。</span>
現金人：當你有很好的才能又能運用自如，你當然會前進得較快。沒人想到他會在07年
        做出這樣的成績--甘乃迪也是--但有時候，球員就是會比原訂發展計畫快上一
        步。他們兩人就是這樣。Joba大大地穩定了我們的牛棚。連 Joba Rules 都有
        所貢獻，因為這規則，所以有些天他是不准被派上場的，這逼使其他人得上場
        救援，因為老實說，他們沒有別的選擇。這樣的發展其實幫助了老方（因為最
        近不再放肆，所以正名為老方 XDD）他最近11次救援有10次封住對手無失分，
        而 KKK 也表現得很好 。這給牛棚帶來很好的效應，假如頻繁使用Joba，說不
        定反而沒有這樣的效果了。

        而且這可以幫助Joba在擔任他還不習慣的救援角色上給予一種保護。我知道媒
        體有些人說，這是我保護Joba避免被教練操壞的方法，沒錯，就是如此。這是
        限制局數來保護年輕投手的規則，何況他以前從未擔任過救援。我們依賴
        Nardi Contreras設計的計畫來保護他。當我瞭解我們將無法從外交易來任何
        幫助----我可不想要放棄農場----我們就開始讓他進牛棚調整，然後逐步將他
        帶到大聯盟，而他也有了精彩的表現。

<span class="f6 hl">Are you still planning to start Joba in ’08?</span>

Yes. All intentions are to return him to the starting rotation in ’08. But
clearly he can do the relief thing. When we drafted him, and Sanchez is
another, we thought he could start or relieve in terms of set-up or closing.
But the intention is to have these guys start.

<span class="f6 hl">問題六：你還是計畫08年讓Joba先發？</span>
現金人：是的。全部的想法就是要他08年回到先發輪值。不過很明顯他可以救援。當
        我們選秀選他時，還有Sanchez也是，我們選他時是想他能先發或當SETUP或
        終結，但還是希望他們擔任先發。


<span class="f6 hl">Posada has mentioned that he’s very impressed with Joba’s maturity.
</span><span class="f6 hl">He’s years ahead of kids his age.</span>

It helps to have that kind of ability. With that ability the results follow,
therefore the confidence goes through the roof. Joba is a very well-balanced
individual and that goes to his upbringing with his father. We’ve only had
our developmental hand on him for a year. He went to the Hawaiian winter
league with Scott Eldred our pitching coach and then Nardi Contreras worked
with him. But this kid deserves the credit for what he has become and how
fast it’s happened.

Hopefully, he will stay level-headed and all the success won’t change him
because he’s really a special individual. Anyone who sits and talks to Joba
comes away very impressed with his sincerity. When we talked to him about the
idea of moving to the bullpen and helping this club, we told him that the
short term gain can’t come at the expense of the long-term effect that he
can have on the organization. That’s a balancing act we have to be careful
with. We look for him to be honest with us and he is so far.

He’s having fun. All the veterans like him. It’s certainly helps the front
office’s initiative because the development of players can’t stop at Triple
AAA; it has to continue at the major league level. There is only so much a
manager or coach or GM can do. What’s more impactful is when a Roger Clemens
or an Andy Pettitte takes the time to let a kid in and they share their
experiences and how to react to situations and this is what it’s like to
be a big-leaguer and this is what it’s like for a 45-year old like Roger
Clemens to keep the uniform on.  You just hope and pray that these kids soak
it up.

It’s the idea of passing the torch. Like when Jimmy Key was here he showed
Andy Pettitte the ropes. Andy grew up with a poster of Roger Clemens on his
wall. Now they’re great friends. These are very vital developmental
opportunities that hopefully our young players will take advantage of.
I’ve really noticed that we have the type of quality character people that
are willing to open up and share their experiences for the betterment of
these young players who will be the Yankees of the future.

<span class="f6 hl">問題七：Posada提到過，他對Joba的成熟印象深刻。跟同年紀小孩比起來，Joba比較早
</span><span class="f6 hl">        熟吧？</span>
現金人：早熟助他有現在這樣的才能。隨著他的才能展現，他會更具有信心。
        Joba是個很均衡的人，這大概是因為他父親的悉心教養。我們大概只培訓了他
        一年，他跟我們的投手教練Scott Eldred以及Nardi Contreras 一起到夏威夷
        冬季聯盟打球，而這小子在短短一年就展露出令人信任的表現。

        希望他能繼續穩健地表現，也希望目前的成功不會帶給他不好的轉變，因為他
        真的是個很特別的人。每個跟Joba說過話的人，都對他的真誠印象深刻。當我
        們跟他談想要把他移到牛棚來幫助球隊，我們跟他說不會以他長期努力的成果
        做為代價，來換取短暫的利益，這是我們必須謹慎的平衡作法，我們希望他能
        誠實以對，而他到目前為止確實做到了。

        他很有趣，所有老鳥都喜歡他。而這也有助於辦公室制服組提出這建議，因為
        球員的培養發展不能止於3A，必須延伸到大聯盟。當火箭人或派帥花時間分享
        他們的經驗，教導他們對種種情況的應對，像是讓他們知道怎樣才是個大聯盟
        球員，或讓他們見識到雖已45歲但還是身披戰袍的火箭人，這些都會很有影響
        的。我希望、祈禱這些孩子能有所吸收。

        這是個薪傳的想法。就好像當初Jimmy Key 在這教過派帥；派帥在牆上貼著火
        箭人的海報而成長，現在他們已是好朋友。這是個很重要的成長機會，而我希
        望我們這些年輕球員能好好利用這個機會。我真的注意到，我們有很多很棒的
        老鳥都願意開放分享自己的經驗，來幫助、改善年輕球員，而這批菜鳥是我們
        洋基的未來。

<span class="f6 hl">Kei Igawa…how disappointing was his 1st year to you and where do you see
</span><span class="f6 hl">him going in the future with the club?</span>

The first year we had higher hopes, clearly. We saw him as a back of the
rotation guy. We didn’t think his transition would be this difficult.
He’s kind of a country guy from Japan. Kind of like Jose Contreras was
from the country of Cuba. He’s from a quieter area.  I think the transition
to New York especially was a little more difficult for him. It doesn’t mean
he can’t be successful in the long run.

He did pitch in front of huge crowds for the Hanshin Tigers. We had some
mechanical adjustments that we had to make. He’s making them and getting
better and better at it. His strikeout per nine improved in the minor leagues
and he actually had a higher strikeout per nine than most of our pitchers in
the majors.  It shows you his stuff is there. Just consistency is an issue.
Certainly the long ball is an issue. But he’s on such a quality contract
when he was claimed by another team on waivers we were not willing to part
with him that easily, especially with the free agent pitching market that is
not very plentiful. He will be a successful major league starter at some point.
It’s just a matter of time when. It can be here; it could be somewhere else.

But we are not going to pull the plug on the guy. We are going to keep his
program going. He’s back with us as a September call-up and hopefully he
will have an opportunity to finish on a high note and feel good about the
hard work, despite not contributing like he or we hoped in ’07. We still
have high hopes.

He was able to shut down two high-powered offenses this year, Boston and
Cleveland. He does have the ability. To be honest I am not quite sure that
he believes he can do it at the major league level yet. Like a pro boxer,
if you get the glassy eye and wobbly knees, well, that was the first half
of the season. He got hit more than he expected and that gave him, I think,
a little hesitancy. It’s our job to make sure that he knows he can succeed.
Now I am purely speculating. He never said he didn’t think he could do it.
But I have to think his confidence was down. But he went down to Triple A.
He did a great job there and now he’s in the mix going forward.  He will
compete for a starting job next year and if that doesn’t work out he could
switch to the bullpen.

<span class="f6 hl">問題八：井川慶，對你來說他第一年的表現你應該很失望吧，你看未來他在這球隊會處
</span><span class="f6 hl">        在怎樣的位置？</span>
現金人：顯然地我們對他第一年本來有更高的期望。本來希望他能支援先發輪值。但沒
        想到他的轉換這麼困難。井川來自日本的郊區，有點像Contreras來自古巴的
        鄉村。井川來自於一個比較溫和平靜的地區。我想對他來說，尤其是轉換到紐
        約是有點困難的。但這並不表示他長期來看就不會成功。

        他曾在阪神虎眾多觀眾前投過球。我們現在在調整他的投球機制，他調整得越
        來越好。他在小聯盟的K9有所改善，事實上，他的K9比起我們大聯盟多數投手
        都還要好。這表示他有 stuff。他就是穩定性的問題。當然被長打也是個問題
        但是即使他身上有鉅額合約，當我們把他放在wavier名單被別隊claim，我們
        也不願那麼簡單地就放棄，特別是投手的自由市場並沒有很多的選擇。他會成
        為一個成功的大聯盟先發投手，只是時間問題而已，可能會是在這裡，也可能
        在別的地方。

        我們可不想放棄他，我們持續他的調整訓練。他九月已隨著擴編名單上來，希
        望他能有個機會來個精彩演出而有個不錯的感覺。即使他的貢獻或07年的表現
        不如我們所預期的，但我們還是抱著高度的期望。

        他今年壓制過兩隻具有高度火力的隊伍：紅襪以及印地安人。他有那能力。
        老實說，我不確定他是否相信自己能在大聯盟層次做到。就好像個職業拳擊手
        ，只有個無神的眼神跟搖晃的雙膝，嗯，這就是他的前半季。他被敲出的安打
        比他所預期的多太多，我認為這造成他的猶豫。想辦法讓他知道他可以成功是
        我們的工作，單純推斷一下，他從沒說過他認為自己無法做到。但我認為他自
        信不夠。他到3A投得很好，他現在應該有所改善。來年他會擔負先發，假如真
        的不行，那會轉換到牛棚。


<span class="f6 hl">Now about the Injury Updates. Is Rocket slated to pitch in Boston this
</span><span class="f6 hl">weekend?</span>

We have not officially named him as a starter. He will throw a bullpen in
Toronto and we’ll see how he’s feeling and how he looks.  If he needs more
time, we will see. We can’t call it yet. He did have two side sessions in
Kansas City and they went well. He will have to do a full bullpen next to
Gator and Joe and then we will learn more.

<span class="f6 hl">問題九：問一下傷兵的現況。火箭人是否表定週末在波士頓對紅襪先發？</span>
現金人：還沒正式排定他作那場的先發。他會在多倫多牛棚試投，我們會看他自己感覺
        如何以及他看起來OK不OK。假如他需要更多時間，那得再看看。現在不能確定
        。（後面兩句不確定什麼意思，請高手幫忙吧。不過反正已經確定他會先發）


<span class="f6 hl">Luis Vizcaino was shut down, how is he feeling?</span>

He threw on flat ground Sunday. I did not hear anything negative. But we
will very careful that when he takes the mound again he’s 100% back.
Obviously, we need him if we are fortunate enough to get a post-season
birth.

<span class="f6 hl">問題十：LV掛傷兵名單，他現在如何？</span>
現金人：他星期天在平地試投，我沒聽到任何不好的訊息。不過，我們會很小心，一定
        要他100％康復才會讓他回投手丘。很明顯的，假如我們很幸運地進入季後賽
        ，我們需要他。

<span class="f6 hl">Now Mussina has had recent troubles. Where does he stand?</span>

Moose is going to start Wednesday in Toronto. Ultimately, at this stage of
the year you got to earn what you can earn. He’s a fighter, he’s competitor
and he’s going to try to get back into this thing for us. I don’t think he&#39;s
done.  I think that he will refocus because he’s a man of great desire and
heart and he will look this winter about how to get back on line for ’08.

In the meantime, he’s looking for that opportunity for when his name is
called. If he can string together some successful outings for us now, it
will increase the level of confidence we have in him and he will get more
opportunities going forward. It’s as simple as that. At this stretch when
you’re trying to secure that post–season birth, your manager is going to
hand the ball to people that are securing the most consistent outs.

There was a time when Mike pushed his way out of the rotation. He can push
his way back in and we are all anxious to see the old Mike Mussina. He will
have a chance to show it on Wednesday.

<span class="f6 hl">問題11：穆帥最近陷入低潮，要安排他怎樣的位置？</span>
現金人：穆帥星期三對多倫多會上場先發。終究來說，在這樣的年紀，你必須努力去獲
        得你能獲得的。他是個戰士，是個競爭者，而且他會試圖恢復身手來幫助大家
        ，我不認為他就此完蛋了。我認為他會重新調整回來，因為他有強烈的慾望和
        心靈，他會在這冬天努力看如何回到08年的陣容中。

        同時，他正在尋求機會上場。假如現在他能連續有好的先發，這將會增加我們
        對他的信心，而他也會得到更多機會，情況就這麼簡單。當現在正尋求季後賽
        門票的緊張時刻，教練一定是會把球交到那些最穩定的先發手上。

        上次穆帥把自己搞出輪值。他可以重回輪值，我們也都渴望能看到老穆。他星
        期三將有個機會表現。


<span class="f6 hl">In this age of sabermetrics, do you have anyone on staff whose job it is to
</span><span class="f6 hl">report to you on statistical trends and analysis?</span>

Absolutely. We definitely do. His name is Mike Fishman. He does a fantastic
job. Our intent is that we evaluate performance on the field, on the major
and minor league levels, by both scouting as well as assessing the numbers.
Sometimes, the numbers are deceiving if you are not reading them properly.
Mike has been a great asset for us and I’m happy he’s here. He joined us
a few years ago.

<span class="f6 hl">問題12：在這個數據統計的年代，你有專職人員跟你報告統計趨勢跟分析嗎？</span>
現金人：當然。我們當然有。他的名字叫做Mike Fishman。他作得相當好。我
        們的目的是要評價場上的表現，不論是大聯盟或小聯盟的球探都會拿數據來評
        估。有時候，假如你解讀那些數字不夠正確，那很容易被數字欺騙。Mike對我
        們而言是個重要的人才，我很高興他能在這。他加入我們已經好幾年了。


<span class="f6 hl">Do you see a time in the near future when Jeter might transition to 1st
</span><span class="f6 hl">base or any another position? </span>

No. First base is the last place I’d think of, to be honest. No, Jeter’s
our shortstop.

<span class="f6 hl">問題13：你認為不久的未來有可能將Jeter移到1壘或任何其他守備位置嗎？</span>
現金人：不會。老實說，一壘是我最後考慮的位置。不過不可能，Jeter是我們的游擊
        手。

<span class="f6 hl">Do you see Joe coming back next year?</span>

Seeing as I am on the big hook too, we will have to wait to see how the
season plays out. Those decisions will be made at the end of the year.

<span class="f6 hl">問題14：你想Joe明年會繼續當教頭嗎？</span>
現金人：我自己的位置也是未知哩。得看這季最後的結果。年底才會作那些決策吧。

<span class="f6 hl">And your future with the club?</span>

Same big hook statement. Well, hopefully we can make our owner proud.
We’re making a run at this thing.

<span class="f6 hl">問題15：你在球隊未來會怎樣？</span>
現金人：一樣是未知囉。嗯，希望我們能交出個足以驕傲的成績，就會有個結果。

<span class="f6 hl">And if Alex opts out, the Yanks will not pursue him?</span>

If he opts out, we won’t pursue him. It’s basically economics. Any
discussions will have to be prior to opting out. If he opts out, we will
have to go in a different direction.

<span class="f6 hl">問題16：如果A-Rod動用脫離條款，洋基將不會出價簽他？</span>
現金人：假如他動用脫離條款，我們將不會出價。這是很簡單的經濟問題，任何協商
        都會比動用脫離條款還優先。假如他動用脫離條款，那我們勢必分道揚鑣。
