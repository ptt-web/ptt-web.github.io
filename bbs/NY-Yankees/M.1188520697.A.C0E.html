Yankees Sweep Red Sox Behind Wang and Cano
Chien-Ming Wang held Boston to one hit. It was the third strong starting
pitching performance in a row for the Yankees.

The sweep was more emphatic last August, when the Yankees rampaged into
Fenway Park and won five games to bury the Boston Red Sox. The best the
Yankees could do this time was to win three at Yankee Stadium and chisel a
chunk from Boston’s sizable lead in the American League East.

They have done that now, finishing off the Red Sox, 5-0, yesterday behind
Chien-Ming Wang, who carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning. The Red Sox
are not quaking, not with a five-game lead, but the Yankees are rolling again.

“It was good, because as a team, we’re behind,” said Robinson Cano&#39;, who
smashed two opposite-field home runs against Curt Schilling. “We need to
start winning some games if we want to make the playoffs. We’re a half-game
up for the wild card, but we’re not worried about the wild card. We’re just
trying to win games.”

The Yankees took that half-game lead over Seattle before the Mariners’ game
in Cleveland last night.

The Mariners come to the Bronx on Monday for a series that could have more
direct impact on the Yankees’ playoff chances than the one they just
completed. But nothing quite matches the atmosphere of a Yankees-Red Sox
series, where history is always a backdrop.

Consider the ninth inning, when the Yankees’ rookie phenom Joba Chamberlain
was ejected by the plate umpire, Angel Hernandez, for throwing two
consecutive 98 mile-an-hour fastballs over the head of Boston’s Kevin
Youkilis.

Chamberlain said he was not trying to throw at Youkilis, and if that is true,
he became a victim of past Yankees-Red Sox scuffles. Derryl Cousins, the crew
chief, said as much after the game.

“There is more than a little bit of history between these clubs,” Cousins
said. “Those were two pretty nasty pitches the young man threw. Up here, you
need to be a little better throwing strikes, and we just had to put a lid on
it before there was a problem.”

Manager Joe Torre called Hernandez’s action stupid, and General Manager
Brian Cashman said he was convinced Chamberlain was not throwing at Youkilis.

“There’s no issue,” Cashman said. “You saw the game.”

Youkilis had an eventful day, but there was nothing obvious that would have
incited Chamberlain. He walked twice against Wang and was ruled out in the
seventh inning for running out of the baseline to avoid Alex Rodriguez’s tag
on a double play, a call that earned an ejection for Red Sox Manager Terry
Francona.

The ejections and confusion brought a wild end to a series that was dominated
by the Yankees’ starting pitching. Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens and Wang
beat the Red Sox in succession, allowing a combined four runs and nine hits
in 20 innings.

Wang, who missed four starts in April with a hamstring strain and did not win
until May 5, is tied for the major league lead in victories, with 16. He has
34 victories since May 7, 2006, the most in the majors in that stretch, and
he has learned to tame a Red Sox team that used to hit him well.

“He was great today,” Torre said. “I told him at the end of the dugout, ‘
Nice going.’ He said, ‘Too many walks.’ ”

Wang walked four, but his stuff was terrific. He has thrown harder since the
pitching coach Ron Guidry urged him to speed up his delivery, and he
complemented his trademark sinker with changeups and sliders.

He struck out David Ortiz twice, including a dazzling sequence in the sixth.
Wang threw a changeup on the first pitch and mixed fastballs and sliders for
the next six pitches, getting Ortiz to miss at a slider to end the inning.
Ortiz had been 12 for 24 against Wang entering the game.

Wang did not allow a hit until Mike Lowell rolled a single through the right
side in the seventh. That was Wang’s 94th pitch, and he still had nine outs
to go. Guidry sounded relieved, because a no-hit bid might have taxed Wang’s
arm.

“You almost have to give him a shot,” Guidry said. “But you worry about
him, and you worry about pitch count. He’s more important to this team than
throwing a no-hitter. If he continues to pitch for another 10 years, he might
get one later on.”

INSIDE PITCH

When the Yankees added three runs in the eighth, they rested Mariano Rivera
and sent Joba Chamberlain for a second inning of work. It was surprising,
because Chamberlain pitched Tuesday, and Torre had said he would not use
Chamberlain for two innings unless he had two days’ rest. Torre said he
could bend that rule depending on pitch counts and feedback from Chamberlain,
but he said he still would not use Chamberlain on consecutive days.
