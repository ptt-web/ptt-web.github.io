ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - As the innings sprinted by Saturday afternoon
and the Tampa Bay Rays still had not managed a hit off C. C. Sabathia,
Joe Girardi&#39;s thoughts drifted to a sunny September afternoon in
Oakland, Calif., in 1996. Returning less than four months after surgery
to remove an aneurysm, David Cone threw seven no-hit innings against
the Athletics. He did not come out for the eighth.
&#34;Big picture,&#34; said Girardi, who caught Cone that day. &#34;The big picture
was the month of October.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">星期六下午的比賽，當光芒球員仍對CC的投球一籌莫展時，Joe Girardi想到
</span><span class="f3 hl">1996年九月在奧克蘭一個晴朗的星期天午後，剛做完動脈瘤手術不到四個月的
</span><span class="f3 hl">David Cone對上運動家隊投出七局的無安打比賽，第八局沒有上場。
</span><span class="f3 hl">Girardi是那場比賽的捕手，他說這是為了十月的比賽。</span>

Cone won Game 3 of the World Series, a pivotal victory in the Yankees&#39;
dynasty. Girardi wants to begin a new one with this group, and his plans
include a healthy Sabathia.

<span class="f3 hl">Cone贏了世界大賽第三場比賽，一場對洋基王朝非常重要的比賽。Girardi希
</span><span class="f3 hl">望能夠帶著現在的球隊開始新的王朝，而這個計畫包括一個健康的CC。</span>

Regardless of the outcome of the at-bat, Kelly Shoppach was going to
be the last hitter Sabathia faced when he batted with two outs in the
eighth inning of the Yankees&#39; 10-0 rout. When Shoppach dumped Sabathia&#39;s
111th pitch into left field for the Rays&#39; first hit, it spared Girardi
from a delicate decision that, at the same time, no one in the clubhouse
would have challenged.

<span class="f3 hl">不管之前的成績如何，Kelly Shoppach在第八局上場，他將會是CC面對的最後
</span><span class="f3 hl">一名打者，他將CC投出的第111球擊向左外野成為光芒的第一支安打，使得
</span><span class="f3 hl">Girardi不用作出困難的抉擇。</span>

&#34;It&#39;s the second start of the year,&#34; Sabathia said. &#34;I definitely
understand the thinking behind it.&#34;
Sabathia, with a laugh, went on to say that he and Girardi &#34;would
have been fighting out there on the mound&#34; if he had retired Shoppach.
He is the Yankees&#39; low-maintenance ace, paid handsomely to pitch, not
to manage, and he knows this. Facing a dangerous lineup that had pummeled
Javier Vazquez a night earlier, Sabathia retired his first 12 hitters and
18 of 19, and finished with five strikeouts.

<span class="f3 hl">這是今年的第二場先發，CC說，我當然知道這代表什麼。
</span><span class="f3 hl">CC笑著說，如果他解決掉Shoppach，他和Girardi一定會為了是否續投爭執
</span><span class="f3 hl">不下。他清楚知道他是洋基不需特別擔心煩惱、付出高薪的王牌投手。面
</span><span class="f3 hl">對讓Javier Vazquez在前一晚吃盡苦頭的打線，CC解決掉他面對的頭12位
</span><span class="f3 hl">打者，19個打者解決掉18個，包括5個三振。</span>

&#34;That was as good as I&#39;ve seen him,&#34; said Shoppach, and he would know.
Shoppach caught Sabathia when they were teammates in Cleveland.
For all of his success with the Indians, Sabathia never came as close
to a no-hitter as he did Saturday. According to the Elias Sports Bureau,
he threw seven no-hit innings on April 7, 2002, against Detroit. Sabathia
pitched no-hitters all the time in Little League, he said, and threw one
in high school, for Vallejo High in California. But, he added, &#34;I didn&#39;t
really have a pitch count back then.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">Shoppach與CC在克里夫蘭是隊友，曾接補過CC的投球，他說CC的投球跟他當
</span><span class="f3 hl">初看到的一樣好。
</span><span class="f3 hl">離開印地安人後，星期六的比賽是CC最接近無安打的比賽。根據Elias Sports
</span><span class="f3 hl">Bureau的紀錄，他在2002四月七號對老虎隊投出七局的無安打。他在少棒聯盟
</span><span class="f3 hl">常投出無安打，高中時也投過一場。</span>

Sabathia threw 104 pitches Sunday night in Boston, and before Saturday&#39;s
game, Girardi and the pitching coach Dave Eiland had resolved that
Sabathia would not exceed 120.
&#34;I think anyone with any baseball sense would have understood,&#34; Eiland
said. &#34;That&#39;s just the way it is. We&#39;re trying to accomplish something
that we try to accomplish every year, and to push the envelope on April
10 wouldn&#39;t make any sense.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">開幕戰對上紅襪時CC投了104球，星期六的比賽前Girardi和投手教練Dave Eiland
</span><span class="f3 hl">設定CC的投球不會超過120。
</span><span class="f3 hl">Eiland說他認為任何對棒球了解的人都能理解，我們每年都嘗試著完成一些事情，
</span><span class="f3 hl">而在四月十號這天太急躁並不合理。</span>

After the Yankees&#39; opening night loss in Boston, Sabathia criticized
himself for nibbling on the corners instead of pitching aggressively.
His next start, he vowed, would be different, and it was. He pounded
the strike zone Saturday, striking out Carl Crawford and Ben Zobrist
on fastballs in the first inning, and his velocity increased as the
game progressed, reaching 96 miles per hour.

<span class="f3 hl">開幕戰輸給紅襪後，CC對自己太過小心而不是更積極面對打者很不滿意，他發誓
</span><span class="f3 hl">下一次先發會不同，而他也做到了。第一局他三振掉Crawford和Zobrist，而且
</span><span class="f3 hl">隨著比賽進行球速越來越快，時速來到96。</span>

&#34;I didn&#39;t look at the scoreboard until the fifth,&#34; said Mark Teixeira,
who snapped an 0-for-17 streak with a fifth-inning double and finished
with three hits. &#34;After the fifth, I go, &#39;Oh my goodness.&#39; Not that
you don&#39;t play hard, but if a ball&#39;s hit right to me, I&#39;m catching it
no matter what.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">鐵爺在第五局擊出二壘安打結束0-17的低潮，最終打出三支安打，他說直到第
</span><span class="f3 hl">五局他才注意到計分板，然後他告訴自己，如果球往這邊來，他無論如何都要
</span><span class="f3 hl">接住它。</span>

With two outs in the bottom of the sixth, Jason Bartlett tested
Teixeira, ripping a sinking liner to his right. The crowd of 29,982
seemed to fall silent as it zipped toward the hole, but the fans
roared when Teixeira dived to grab it. For about an inning, Teixeira&#39;s
play qualified as the best of the game. Then in the seventh B. J. Upton
ripped a topspin-loaded rocket off the dirt by third base. It was headed
down the line until it smacked into Alex Rodriguez&#39;s glove. Playing
behind the bag, Rodriguez dived to his right to backhand the ball, then
jumped up to throw out Upton to end the inning. Even the Rays partisans
stood and saluted.
&#34;That was one of the best plays you&#39;re going to see all year,&#34; Teixeira
said. &#34;When you make a few plays like that and the way C. C. was throwing
the ball, you thought it could happen.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">六局下半兩人出局，Jason Bartlett擊向右邊邊線，全場29982名觀眾似乎都屏
</span><span class="f3 hl">息不敢出聲，當鐵爺接住球時全場歡呼，在當時這是全場最精采的一球。接著
</span><span class="f3 hl">在七局下半，BJ Upton擊向三壘方向，沿著邊線滾動直到A-Rod接住它，然後傳
</span><span class="f3 hl">球刺殺Upton結束這一局，即使是光芒的球迷也站起來為他歡呼。
</span><span class="f3 hl">鐵爺說這絕對是今年最精采的守備之一，當你看到那麼精采的守備還有CC投球
</span><span class="f3 hl">的樣子你會想這（無安打）一定會發生。</span>

Except that Girardi already knew that it would not. Sabathia ended the
seventh with 102 pitches. Just in case, Chan Ho Park had been warming
up. The Yankees&#39; bullpen is situated along the left-field line here,
and Sabathia could have seen Dave Robertson getting loose in the eighth.
But he did not. &#34;I just worry about what I need to worry about,&#34; Sabathia
said. Sabathia said he did not even know his pitch count when he started
the eighth by getting Willy Aybar to ground out. After Pat Burrell flied
out, Shoppach swung and missed at a changeup, then poked a two-seamer
into left field. &#34;I thought if anybody was to do it, it was supposed to
be me,&#34; Shoppach said. &#34;I know he probably thinks the opposite. But when
I stepped into the box, that&#39;s exactly what I was thinking.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">除了Girardi以外。CC投完七局已經用了102球，為了以防萬一公園已經在熱身，
</span><span class="f3 hl">洋基的牛棚位於左邊，CC可能可以看到Dave Robertson，但他沒有，他說，我只
</span><span class="f3 hl">擔心我必須擔心的事。
</span><span class="f3 hl">CC說他不知道他的投球數，第八局一開始他讓Aybar打出滾地球出局，Burrell飛
</span><span class="f3 hl">球出局，之後Shoppach對著一個變化球揮空，然後將一個二縫線打向左外野。
</span><span class="f3 hl">Shoppach說當他站上打擊區時他想如果有個人要打出安打，那一定就是我了，雖
</span><span class="f3 hl">然CC想的可能想反。</span>

By the time the ball bounced in the outfield, Girardi had left the dugout
and was signaling for Robertson to come in. The Yankees&#39; infield surrounded
Sabathia, and his teammates in the dugout greeted him with a standing
ovation. Because the Yankees won, Sabathia said he was not disappointed.
His reaction sounded like Cone&#39;s. After his performance in Oakland, Cone
said he would &#34;never wonder if this could have been the last opportunity
to throw one.&#34; Three years later, Cone did something even better. He
pitched a perfect game against Montreal on July 18, 1999. Girardi was
his catcher. &#34;It&#39;s hard to say I want to throw a no-hitter one day because
it&#39;s so hard to do and you have to be lucky,&#34; Sabathia said. &#34;But when
you get that close and you&#39;re in the game, you want to try to have it
happen for you.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">當球在左外野落地時Girardi離開休息區更換投手讓Robertson上場，洋基的內野
</span><span class="f3 hl">環繞著CC，休息區內的隊友也站起來恭賀他。這場比賽洋基贏了，CC 說他並不
</span><span class="f3 hl">失望。聽起來很像Cone的反應，Cone在奧克蘭的比賽後說他從來沒想過這可能是
</span><span class="f3 hl">他最後投出無安打比賽的機會。三年後，1999年7月18，對上蒙特羅，他做得更
</span><span class="f3 hl">好，投出一場完全比賽，Girardi是他的捕手。
</span><span class="f3 hl">CC說很難說出要投出一場無安打比賽這種話，因為這很難而你必須要很幸運，但
</span><span class="f3 hl">當你很靠近這個紀錄且你在場上，你會希望讓這一切發生。</span>
