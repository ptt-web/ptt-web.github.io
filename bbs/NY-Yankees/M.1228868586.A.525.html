The Yankees started the Winter Meetings by meeting twice with CC Sabathia.
Brian Cashman and Joe Girardi were pleased with the results.

<a href="http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2008/12/09/girardi-interview-coming-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2008/12/09/girardi-interview-coming-up/</a>

All of the managers attend the Winter Meetings and have scheduled times that
they meet with the media. Joe Girardi’s session will be today at 6:30 p.m.
(ET), so check back later to see what he had to say


<a href="http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2008/12/09/hunter-sabathia-can-handle-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2008/12/09/hunter-sabathia-can-handle-new-york/</a>

Hall of Fame nice guy Torii Hunter was just in the media workroom to announce
details of a charity project he is financing to benefit kids in Orange County,
Pine Bluff, Ark. (his hometown), Las Vegas and Minneapolis. He has already
donated $1 million of his own money for educational and athletic programs.

Hunter also spoke about his friend CC Sabathia. He said that while Sabathia
may want to play on the West Coast, he’s not wary about playing in New York
and would certainly handle it well. Hunter, as you would expect, hopes CC
signs with the Angels.


<a href="http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2008/12/09/torre-talks-about-some-yankee-topics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://yankees.lhblogs.com/2008/12/09/torre-talks-about-some-yankee-topics/</a>

Joe Torre just spoke to reporters and talked about a few Yankees issues:

Andy Pettitte didn’t call Torre to ask about pitching for the Dodgers.
His agents called Ned Colletti. Joe then called Andy. “I jumped at it,”
Torre said. “I took the opportunity to let him know we have interest.”

Pettitte told Torre he wanted to stay with the Yankees. “They’re his
first choice,” Torre said.

Torre also spoke to Joe Girardi said. He said he firmly believes that
Girardi will be better in his role next season. “He had a lot of pressure
on him,” said Torre, who is very close with Girardi. “I think it ate on
him a little bit.”

Torre talked about how difficult it can be for a young manager to come to
a successful team with established players.

Torre also said he felt Robinson Cano could bounce back because he’s too
 talented not to.

Here is what is known for sure on CC:

Yankees: Have an offer on the table. Nothing has changed.

Brewers: Have an offer on the table. Contrary to some reports, they have
not raised it. Sabathia did not bother to hang around Vegas yesterday to
meet with them. He sent his agents.

Red Sox: Have met with Sabathia and possibly have made an offer. Terry Francona
laughed out loud when asked about the idea of a long-term deal. File this under
the Red Sox making trouble.

Angels: They have prioritized Mark Teixeira but could make Sabathia an offer if
only to drive the Teixeira process. Teixeira, according to Torii Hunter, is
having trouble sleeping and wants to ake a decision soon.

Giants: Depending what you want to believe, they could be in the mix.

It’s going to be a long week.
