Christian writes: Hey Peter, what do you see the Yankees doing in terms of
the outfield, first base and starting pitcher this offseason?

Answer: I’m not sure you’ll see much of anything in the outfield. Damon,
Matsui and Nady will be back and Abreu could be as well depending what he
wants. Melky Cabrera is at a career crossroads. But Austin Jackson is making
progress and Brett Gardner could be a helpful player as well. First base is
more complicated. Teixeira sounds great but would come at a great cost.
Posada could play there at some point. So could Damon, maybe. In my opinion
they need to bring back Mussina and/or Pettitte and bring in a front-line
starter like Sabathia. Burnett would be a risk given his injury history.

Chris writes: What are the chances the yankees transition Jesus Montero to 1B
for next year mid-season or 2010? I know he hasn’t made it far through the
system but the yanks can’t afford to sign Tex, CC, and A-Rod at their
current rates, so why not transition Jesus and keep the spot open for him.
Just wondering your take on this as I have finally started looking towards
2009.

Answer: Montero will be 19 in November and played low Class A ball this
season. He is not going to be MLB-ready any time soon, the end of 2010 maybe.
Beyond that, with Posada having three more seasons, they need to give Montero
every chance to catch before thinking about moving him.

N.M. in Chicago writes: Everything I thought about the Yankees this season
proved wrong. Girardi has been over his head, the bench was terrible and
A-Rod has gone back to what he did in 2007. Would Mattingly or Torre make a
difference?

Answer: It’s impossible to say. Girardi could stand to loosen up a bit, but
veteran players don’t usually much care who the manager is as long as they
play. Torre or Mattingly can’t just tell somebody to hit with runners on
base. This was going to be a difficult season from the start and then the
injuries hit. No team goes to the playoffs every season, it was just a matter
of when it happened. Now it’s a matter of what they do about it.

The guys at Full Count Pitch did an interview with me a few days after they
quizzed Sweeny Murti. So check those out.
