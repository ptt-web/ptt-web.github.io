MINNEAPOLIS (AP)—Joba Chamberlain received his long-awaited promotion, and
the rookie right-hander will make his first start for the Yankees at home in
the Bronx.

Manager Joe Girardi said the 22-year-old will take the mound at Yankee
Stadium on Tuesday night against Toronto and be limited to 65 or 70 pitches.

After deliberating about the decision during New York’s off day Thursday and
consulting with general manager Brian Cashman, Girardi said Friday he decided
to keep Andy Pettitte on his regular throwing schedule and use the
left-hander for Monday’s series finale against the Twins.

New York has been grooming Chamberlain for the rotation since selecting him
out of the University of Nebraska with the 41st overall pick in the 2006
amateur draft. After posting a 0.38 ERA in 19 appearances last season,
Chamberlain had a 2.28 ERA in 20 games out of the bullpen this year.

After throwing on the side Friday, Chamberlain was excited.

“I feel great. Everything is going well. Every `i’ is dotted, and every ‘t
’ is crossed, so far,” Chamberlain said.


Joba下星期二將在主場先發對戰藍鳥,會投65到70球
