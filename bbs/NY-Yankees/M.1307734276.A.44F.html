This isn&#39;t an overreaction to the Yankees being swept by the Red Sox, as bad as

that was it was just three games after all. However, the Yankees do need to

call up Jesus Montero for help simply because he is the most fit to do the job

they need done.



First of all, Russell Martin is hurt. He has a back injury that not only kept

him out of the last two games, but it was bad enough that they had to send him

for an MRI to get checked out. Combine that with a knee injury that needed

surgery over the offseason and Martin’s body seems like a ticking time bomb.


Martin really isn&#39;t getting the job done at the plate either. Sure, his overall

numbers are good. He&#39;s played good defense while putting up a .785 OPS or a

113 OPS+. However, most of that came from a hot start to the season where he

hit .328 with a 1.099 OPS over the first 17 games of the year.


<span class="b2 hl">Since April 25 he has been downright bad though, hitting just .189 with a
</span><span class="b2 hl">
</span><span class="b2 hl">.614 OPS</span>. Those are bad numbers even from a good defensive catcher.

The Yankees might as well of re-signed Jose Molina if they want a catcher with

those numbers.


Francisco Cervelli doesn&#39;t offer much relief either. He can&#39;t even throw the

ball down to second base he&#39;s that bad defensively and he isn&#39;t much better

with the stick either. In just 42 plate appearances this year, he is hitting

just .222 with a .654 OPS and a 78 OPS+.


Now Montero can&#39;t provide the defense Martin has been able to provide, but he

certainly is the best hitter of the three. Also, I don&#39;t care what people say

about his defense, he can&#39;t be worse than Cervelli. If he can throw the ball to

second base without the runners consistently taking third then he&#39;s ahead of

the game.


Ideally the Yankees would call him up and have him split the rest of the season

with Martin behind the plate and have Montero DH a few times a week as well.

That way they get some quality at bats from their catcher for a change and some

good defense from Martin a few times a week as well. Who knows, maybe if Martin

isn&#39;t playing so much his bat might come back to the April form none of us can

seem to forget.

Call up Montero, now!!


馬丁目前帳面表現看起來還不錯,但是在4/25以後成績明顯的難看,作者還酸了他一下

要有一個防守不錯但成績普普的話續簽二哥不就好了...XD,另外Cervelli並沒有提供了

多少幫助,他的阻殺是個問題,而Montero很明顯的比Cervelli還要有更強的進攻能力,只要

他的防守不要太差的話...在馬丁傷勢變成不定時炸彈的前提下,叫Montero上來似乎是個

answer...
