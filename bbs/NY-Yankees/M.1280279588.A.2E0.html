Joba Chamberlain has lost his exclusive eighth-inning job, but is in no
jeopardy of being sent to the minors, sources told The Post.

Joe Girardi refused to say on Monday night that Chamberlain had lost his job,
but a club official explained: “The first thing we felt we had to do was
take him out of the eighth inning.”

That began last night when David Robertson and Boone Logan protected a
one-run lead in the eighth in what became a 3-2 victory over the Indians.
Robertson replaced Javier Vazquez with a runner on first and no outs and
induced a double play. Logan then came in to strike out lefty Shin-Soo Choo.

It is possible Chamberlain will be used as part of a mix in the eighth
inning. But no longer does he have sole responsibility for the inning when he
is available.

“We would like for him to pitch at the level he is capable of pitching at,’
’ Girardi said prior to tonight’s game against the Indians.

What is not possible, at least for now, is sending Chamberlain to the minors
for two major reasons: 1) The Yanks feel it would be a terrible message to
bust somebody from main set-up man all the way to Scranton in one move, so
they will try to fix him outside the eighth inning and 2) They do not believe
Chamberlain is failing because of an attitude problem. Yankee officials
actually consider Chamberlain a hard worker. In other words they are not
looking at this how they viewed a situation with Melky Cabrera in 2008. That
season the Yanks thought Cabrera had become lazy and that was a factor in his
struggles, so they did demote him in mid-August to Triple-A.

Still, Chamberlain’s struggles have the Yanks checking out available
eighth-inning options. They called the Royals last week about Joakim Soria
and were told the closer was not available. They are interested in Toronto’s
Scott Downs, but an executive from another AL team described the Blue Jays’
 demands for the lefty as “not something I can imagine anyone paying for a
set-up man.”

In fact, right now, the price is being described by multiple executives as
too high for all the main available relievers such as Washington’s Matt
Capps, and Pittsburgh’s Octavio Dotel and Joel Hanrahan. The Mets and Red
Sox are among many teams looking for relief help.

The Yanks are preparing as if they might have to solve the problem
internally. That begins with trying to remedy the inconsistency of
Chamberlain and hoping Damaso Marte heals well from his shoulder problems.
They also imagine that, at some point, Phil Hughes could go into the pen to
keep him under his innings cap while bolstering the relief crew. The Yanks
also are willing to consider if a minor league starter could potentially help
down the stretch and in the playoffs, with hard-throwing Ivan Nova a
possibility.

The Diamondbacks did request Chamberlain last week as part of a package for
Dan Haren. However, the Yanks were only willing to incorporate Haren’s
salary over the next few years if a trade was essentially a salary dump and
the Yanks had to only give up middling prospects.
