Top 10 Second Basemen Under 30

Honestly, this list was dizzying to put together. Second base is a more
defensively demanding position than first base, so we put a little more
emphasis on defense with this list than that one – we&#39;ll do the same for
shortstop. And there aren&#39;t many second basemen in baseball who are under 30
and have proven themselves offensively over more than a couple of seasons.

Chase Utley, Dustin Pedroia, Ian Kinsler, and Dan Uggla have. After that, we
see a bit of a drop-off in talent, though Kelly Johnson isn&#39;t too far behind
the four players mentioned above. Robinson Cano is coming off a .307 wOBA
season. Aaron Hill was good in 2007 but missed four months in 2008 due to a
concussion. Brandon Phillips was a below-average hitter on the road last
season (.300 wOBA) and not great at home (.330) – defense accounted for,
he&#39;s a better 5x5 Roto asset than MLB second baseman. And Rickie Weeks and
Howie Kendrick fans have been waiting for breakout seasons since Jemile Weeks
was a freshman at Miami.

This leaves us with a list that could change a lot over the next nine months.
Cano could continue to struggle and slide down to an honorable mention. Ian
Kinsler could very well claim the title of best second baseman in the game.
Alberto Callaspo could build on his 2008 success and earn a spot among the
Top 5 players on this list next season. Ryan Theriot could make us regret
leaving him off the list entirely.

Whatever happens, this list will be fun to look back at in a year, as change
– perhaps drastic change – will occur in the top young second basemen ranks

Top 10 Second Basemen Under the age of 30

1. Chase Utley      29.8    PHI     MLB

   Yes, hip injury is a concern; No, it&#39;s not yet enough of one to keep him

   from sitting atop this list


2. Dustin Pedroia   25.2    BOS     MLB

   Brought IsoP from .112 in &#39;06 (98 PA) to .125 in &#39;07 and .167 in &#39;08;

   7.2% K was 4th in the AL


3. Ian Kinsler      26.3    TEX     MLB

   Finally broke out into a clearly above-average offensive 2B in &#39;08:

   .379 wOBA after .344 in &#39;07


4. Dan Uggla        28.6    FLA     MLB

   Compensated for poor &#39;08 contact rate (27.6% K) w/ a bunch of power

   (.254 IsoP); 12.4% BB

5. Kelly Johnson    26.6    ATL     MLB

   Significant drops in IsoP and BB% from &#39;07 to &#39;08 keep him outside of

   our top three 2B under 30


<span class="f3 hl">6. Robinson Cano    26.0    NYY     MLB</span>

<span class="f3 hl">   Had a .363 BABIP with a 20% LD in &#39;06; .286 with 20% in &#39;08; good bet to</span>

<span class="f3 hl">   rebound some in &#39;09</span>


7. Aaron Hill       26.6     TOR     MLB

   After appearing to be on verge of an &#39;08 breakout, concussion ended his

   season in late-May


8. Brandon Phillips 27.3     CIN     MLB

   Heralded defensive player who has some pop (.181 IsoP in &#39;08) but

   doesn&#39;t reach base much


9. Rickie Weeks     26.1     MIL     MLB

   Ranked more on potential than production; poor contact, solid BB%, signs of

   promising power


10. Howie Kendrick  25.3     LAA     MLB

    Ugly walk rates (2.9% between &#39;07 and &#39;08) combined with injury woes

    bring his value down

Honorables: Asdrubal Cabrera (CLE), Jose Lopez (SEA), and Alberto Callaspo
(KC).

* Our rankings combine a player&#39;s ceiling with the odds that he&#39;ll reach it
and favor recent production

** Ages are as of November 1st, 2008

*** Level is the highest level the player has reached
