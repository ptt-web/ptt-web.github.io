KANSAS CITY --

    Often overshadowed by his own teammates and several other high-profile
starting pitchers, Chien-Ming Wang sometimes hasn&#39;t received due credit for
his results. But Yankees manager Joe Torre said he considers Wang &#34;one of the
big guys,&#34; someone who is a true ace.

    &#34;But there is always somebody else that is going to get more attention
than him,&#34; Torre said.

    That may still be true after Sunday&#39;s performance, but Wang&#39;s results
are necessitating as much publicity and discussion regarding the Cy Young Award
as several of the American League&#39;s elite pitchers, including Johan Santana,
Josh Beckett and C.C. Sabathia. Wang tossed seven innings of three-run ball
on Sunday and earned the win in the Yankees&#39; 6-3 victory over the Royals at
Kauffman Stadium.

    &#34;I think he is [one of the best],&#34; catcher Jorge Posada said. &#34;I think he
has proven a lot. He gets better and better every time he goes out there. He
is showing it and not saying anything about it.

    &#34;He is very low-key and very quiet about it, and I think that is why
people are not giving him the credit that he deserves. I think he deserves
all the credit in the world.&#34;

    The win lengthened New York&#39;s lead to four games ahead of the Detroit and
five ahead of Seattle in the AL Wild Card race. The Yankees have won five
straight games, their longest streak since Aug. 3-7.

    On Sunday, Wang&#39;s batterymate and his third baseman provided the help.
Posada broke a 3-3 tie with a two-run double in the fifth inning.

    Alex Rodriguez continued his assault on the record books with his 52nd
homer of the season, his fourth of the series and his seventh in the Yankees&#39;
past five games.

    Rodriguez has homered in five consecutive games, tying a career high.
The long ball also gave him a Major League-leading 140 RBIs this season,
marking just the fifth time a Yankees player has driven in 140 runs since
1939.

    &#34;What Alex has done in the short period of time is pretty amazing,&#34;
Torre said.

    The offense supplied plenty of support for Wang, who earned his 18th win
this season and kept a tie for the Major League lead with Boston&#39;s Beckett,
who also won his 18th on Sunday.

    Wang also ranks second in the AL in winning percentage (.750) and lowered
his ERA to 3.69, just outside of the top 10. New York is 8-1 in Wang&#39;s last
nine starts.

    &#34;He is our horse,&#34; Posada said. &#34;He is our No. 1. You try to get him some
runs. ... He has been very, very key for us.&#34;

    Wang, who missed time at the beginning of the season with a strained
right hamstring, has the chance to become the first 20-game winner in the
Major Leagues in the last two seasons. In 2006, Wang led the Majors with 19
wins and finished second in the voting for the AL Cy Young Award.

    &#34;He certainly hasn&#39;t done anything wrong,&#34; Torre said of Wang&#39;s Cy Young
chances. &#34;And any time you pitch with the urgency to win -- Beckett is doing
the same thing, obviously -- it is pretty impressive. This kid -- how quickly
he has turned into someone you count on, on a regular basis -- I think is
very impressive.&#34;

    Before the game, Posada approached Wang and told him to shorten his
stride slightly. Kauffman Stadium&#39;s mound is flatter than most, and Posada
wanted to make certain that Wang still kept his sinker down.

    Wang was efficient, tossing just 25 pitches through three innings. He had
 some trouble in the fourth, when he permitted a three-run double to Alex
Gordon on a sinker that was supposed to be away but was left in the middle of
the plate.

    But Wang quickly settled down and tossed scoreless innings in the fifth,
sixth and seventh. He tied a season high with four walks but coaxed 11 ground-
ball outs.

    &#34;I just forgot about it and slowed down,&#34; Wang said of Gordon&#39;s game-tying
 double.

    Afterward, Torre said that Wang was a &#34;little Jekyll and Hyde,&#34; but it&#39;s
a testament to Wang that he didn&#39;t have his best stuff and was still able to
produce a quality start.

    &#34;He can get away with stuff,&#34; Posada said. &#34;He can get away with not
h4\aving a sinker. He can get away with not having a changeup or a split-finger
. He has been that effective.&#34;

    Wang went at least six innings for the 18th time in his last 19 starts and
 the 25th time in 27 starts this season. While the injury short-circuited any
chance the right-hander would have of leading the AL in innings pitched, few
starters have consistently worked deeper into games. Wang has averaged more
than 6 2/3 innings per outing, one of the top marks in the AL.

    &#34;He has been able to throw his slider for a strike and been able to expand
 the zone with his fastball,&#34; Posada said.

    Wang received the necessary run support when Rodriguez hit his 52nd homer
of the season -- and fourth this series -- off Zack Greinke in the first
inning, giving the Yankees a 2-0 lead. A-Rod is the Majors&#39; leader in runs
scored (132), RBIs and homers.

    &#34;It&#39;s a magical season,&#34; Rodriguez said. &#34;I am enjoying it. The reason I
am getting pitched to is those guys behind me.&#34;

    Four innings later, one of those guys behind him -- Posada -- broke a 3-3
tie with a two-run double off John Bale down the right-field line.

   &#34;We got some guys on base, and you want to try and stay in the middle of
the field,&#34; Posada said. &#34;You have a left-hander in there, and I got a great
pitch to hit.&#34;

    And that was all Wang needed for another quiet win.
