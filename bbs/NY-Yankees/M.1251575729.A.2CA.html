Posada likely to return on Sunday
Girardi decides to sit dinged-up backstop on Saturday

NEW YORK -- The Yankees on Saturday played what they hope will be their final
game without Jorge Posada, who also sat out the previous two days with a
bruised left ring finger.

&#34;I feel like that extra day is going to help him,&#34; manager Joe Girardi said
prior to the game on Saturday. &#34;He wants to play, but to be on the safe side,
let&#39;s see if we can give this another 24 hours.&#34;

Posada injured the finger when a foul tip off the bat of Nelson Cruz nicked
his glove in the eighth inning of Wednesday&#39;s game against the Rangers.
X-rays taken at Yankee Stadium that evening were negative, but the finger has
been sore ever since.

On Saturday, Posada, 28, sported a wrap -- what Girardi called &#34;a
contraption&#34; -- on the finger, which the team hopes will help dull the pain
when he catches. Though he did not play, Posada caught a bullpen session to
test the finger.

&#34;I think he wants to play every day,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;I think he wanted to
play yesterday.&#34;

Posada, batting .277 with 17 homers, had been riding something of a hot
streak before the injury -- a .384 average, two home runs and eight RBIs over
his past four games. Jose Molina has started all three games in his absence.

The injury news was no better for outfielder Brett Gardner, who took Saturday
off from batting practice after feeling a recurrence of pain in his left
thumb. Gardner, who has been on the disabled list with a fractured thumb
since July 26, said he planned on being cautious with the thumb going forward.

&#34;I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s something that I should work through,&#34; Gardner said.
&#34;It doesn&#39;t feel like I messed it up.&#34;
