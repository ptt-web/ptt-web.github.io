New York Yankees Rumors: Two Years For Ichiro?

Early Wednesday morning the word was that the New York Yankees and Ichiro
Suzuki were very close to finishing up a deal, but the complete language of
the agreement was not completed according to tweets from FOX Sports’ Ken
Rosenthal and CBSSports.com’s Jon Heyman. WFAN On air personality Craig
Carton first reported the deal as done via Twitter.

As more information was gathered and the day progressed if became apparent
that the Yankees and Ichiro’s agent Tony Attanasio were working out the
framework for one of three types of deals — a simple one-year contract, a
one-year deal with vesting performance options and a simple two-year deal
according to Heyman.
NY Post reporter Joel Sherman tweeted that the Philadelphia Phillies were in
the mix and could be the reason that the Yankees may have to move to a
two-year deal. Sherman suggests the deal could be worth $12-14 million if two
years. Suzuki had told the Yankees that he would accept a one-year deal early
in the offseason and it has been noted that he prefers to be on the Yankees.
Later in the evening, David Walstein of The New York Times tweeted the
Phillies were pushing hard for Suzuki behind former Seattle Mariners general
manager and current Phillies adviser Pat Gillick.
This would be an interesting stray from the way the Yankees have performed
business with free agents to this point in the offseason. One-year contracts
have been the norm and if the player was not amiable to it then the Yankees
would be on their way. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman did say that the
Yankees made a multiyear offer to Jeff Keppinger, but he eschewed it to take
a more stable role with the Chicago White Sox.
The Yankees would be investing a second year on a player who will turn 40 in
2014. A two-year deal would indicate that the Yankees are not bullish on any
of their young players being able to come up in 2014 to take on a full-time
role in the Bronx and Ichiro would make an affordable transition until one or
two of their up and coming outfielders such as Mason Williams and Tyler
Austin, are ready for the Majors.
The deal for Ichiro is said to be close enough that it could be settled
Thursday according to The Star Ledger reporter Jeff Bradley.
Yankees will need right-handed hitting outfielder
Once this deal goes down, the Yankees will be in need of a right-handed bat
for the outfield and preferably one with some pop. Scott Hairston has been on
the Yankees radar for quite some time.
The Yankees have competition for their crosstown rivals, the New York Mets,
for whom Hairston hit 20 homers in 398 plate appearances in 2012 while
recording an overall slash line of .263/.299/.504. He mashed lefties to the
tune of .286/.317/.550 in 199 plate appearances.
Hairston is said to be looking for at least a two-year deal according to ESPN
New York’s Adam Rubin. Cody Ross is still available, but he too would want a
multiyear deal (three-years, $25 million range) after a successful season
with the Boston Red Sox where he hit 22 home runs and had a slash line of
.267/.326/.481 in 528 plate appearances.
