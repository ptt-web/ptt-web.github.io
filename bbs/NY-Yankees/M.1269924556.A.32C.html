Girardi intrigued by &#39;switch-pitcher&#39;
Venditte likely to appear in Yanks&#39; game against Braves

SARASOTA, Fla. -- Manager Joe Girardi does not usually have input on which
Minor Leaguers accompany the Yankees on Spring Training road trips. This
spring, however, Girardi made one special request.

Pat Venditte, the ambidextrous &#34;switch-pitcher,&#34; will accompany New York
to Lake Buena Vista, Fla., on Tuesday for a 1:05 p.m. ET split-squad game
against the Atlanta Braves on MLB.TV. There is a good chance that Girardi
will call on Venditte to pitch in his first Major League Spring Training
game.

&#34;I&#39;ve wanted to see it all spring,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;I think it&#39;s interesting.&#34;

Venditte, 24, first gained national fame during a Class A game in 2008, in
a comical sequence with Mets Minor Leaguer Ralph Henriquez.

Henriquez, a switch-hitter, began moving from batter&#39;s box to batter&#39;s box,
while Venditte shifted his specially designed six-finger glove from his right
hand to his left. After several cycles, umpires ruled that Henriquez had to
commit to one side of the plate before Venditte committed to his right arm
or left.

&#34;That was like a Laurel and Hardy thing,&#34; Girardi said.

One month later, the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation released a
series of rules pertaining to Venditte&#39;s situation, allowing both batters
and pitchers to switch sides once per at-bat.

Venditte split time between Class A Charleston and Tampa last season,
compiling a 4-2 record and 22 saves.

CC Sabathia is scheduled to start the game for the Yankees. And because
Sabathia will scale back his workload to 75 pitches in his final tune-up
before the regular season, there is a good chance that the Yankees will
have enough available innings for Venditte to pitch.

Aceves hurting: Reliever Alfredo Aceves will not make his scheduled outing
on Tuesday due to back tightness. The Yankees will monitor his situation over
the next few days before determining whether Aceves, who struggled through
back pain last September and October, will be available for Sunday night&#39;s
opener against the Red Sox. ... Girardi said the Yankees are considering
having Phil Hughes start the season in the Minor Leagues, which would allow
them to carry an extra reliever on the roster for the first few days of April.
The club does not need a fifth starter until its April 17 game against the
Texas Rangers.
