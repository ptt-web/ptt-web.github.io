NEW YORK -- Derek Jeter&#39;s 3,000th career hit went into the books as a solo
home run, as the Yankees captain logged hits in his first two plate
appearances against the Rays&#39; David Price on Saturday, joining the
illustrious club.

Derek Jeter 用一分 HR 進入了 3000 安的成員,在這個星期六,洋基的隊長在第一第二打
席面對 Ray 的 David Price 加入了這個傑出的俱樂部.

Jeter became the 28th player to reach the historic plateau, belting the
eighth pitch of his third-inning at-bat against the left-handed Price into
the left-field seats on a sun-splashed afternoon at Yankee Stadium.

Jeter 成為第 28 位完成這里程碑的球員,在陽光閃耀的洋基主場,第 3 局下半面對由左
投 Price 第 8 個球一棒打向左外野的觀眾席.

The Yankees&#39; bench and bullpen emptied to greet Jeter as he rounded the bases
and touched home plate, and the Rays&#39; players spilled onto the field out of
the visitors&#39; dugout, applauding Jeter&#39;s achievement as the scoreboard
flashed, &#34;Congratulations, Derek.&#34;

洋基的休息區和牛棚瞬間一空,全都圍繞在本壘板周圍歡迎 Jeter 的歸來,並且 Ray 的球
員也走出休息區,為 Jeter 鼓掌表達恭賀之意,就在此時,
洋基主場的記分板也秀出了 &#34; Congratulations, Derek.&#34; 字樣
.

With play interrupted for several minutes, Jeter acknowledged the wildly
cheering crowd, raising his fists to the triple-decked facility for a curtain
call most unlike any in the Stadium&#39;s history.

就在場上中斷的幾分鐘, Jeter 向著全場瘋狂歡呼的球迷,舉起拳頭致意.

Jeter became just the second player in Major League history to log his
3,000th hit as a homer, joining Wade Boggs, who did it on Aug. 7, 1999, while
playing for Tampa Bay.

Jeter 成為繼 1999 年 8 月 7 日 Wade Boggs 於坦帕灣後大聯盟歷史上第二位以 HR 作
為 3000 安打的球員,

Already a five-time World Series champion, 12-time All-Star and five-time
Gold Glove Award winner, Jeter now has confirmed entry into a club that
counts consistency and longevity among its mandates for inclusion.

已經獲得 5 次世界大賽冠軍, 12 次獲選明星賽和 5 次金手套獎, Jeter 已經確定加入
了這個俱樂部.

&#34;I&#39;m a Derek Jeter fan,&#34; said Hall of Famer Rod Carew, who rapped his 3,000th
hit in 1985. &#34;I&#39;ve watched this young man play since day one. I&#39;ve always
enjoyed the way he has played the game. When you go out there every day and
you&#39;re consistent, good things happen.

&#34;我是 Derek Jeter 的球迷&#34; 名人堂球員 Rod Carew 這麼說著,他在 1985 年完成了他的
 3000 支安打.
&#34;我從第一天就開始注意這年輕人,我一直很享受他的比賽,若你持之以恆每天上場,
好事就會發生.&#34;

It is a lesson Jeter has taken to heart. Jeter was amazed to learn he would
be the first man to reach the 3,000 hits mark while wearing a Yankees
uniform, and just the 11th to reach 3,000 with a single team.


&#34;Playing well gets you here; consistency keeps you here,&#34; Jeter said. &#34;That&#39;s
the thing I&#39;ve always tried to focus on.&#34;

Shortly after Jeter&#39;s homer on Saturday, Boggs issued a statement
congratulating the Yankees&#39; captain.

&#34;Congratulations, first of all, to Derek Jeter on joining the 3,000-hit club.
It is an exclusive honor, achieved by only a select group, that not many
people can call their own. It is a monumental achievement, and Derek has
climbed the mountain. He&#39;s reached that honor, where he can stake his flag in
the mountain and call it his own.

&#34;I had the opportunity to play with Derek when he was a rookie in 1996, and I
had no doubts that Derek would reach this milestone. He is a very consistent
player and he never deviated from his game. When you stay healthy and you are
consistent and compile a lengthy career like Derek has done, you have the
opportunity to reach that 3,000 hit plateau.

&#34;Reaching the 3,000 hit mark is another piece of the legacy that Derek has
created. It won&#39;t be too long now before we are on the verandah in
Cooperstown at the Otesaga Hotel celebrating his Induction to the Hall of
Fame.&#34;


&#34;That&#39;s what has happened to Derek over the years as a hitter in the big
leagues. He&#39;s been a consistent player, a consistent hitter, and I just want
to say: &#39;Derek, welcome to the 3,000-hit club and I want to wish you
continued success.&#39;&#34;

New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also issued a statement.

&#34;Long before joining the 3,000-hit club, Derek Jeter became another one of
New York&#39;s icons because he represents what is best in the spirit of our
city: an unbreakable belief that with hard work and determination, anything
can be accomplished. Perhaps above all else, Derek is someone who loves this
city and who has a long history of giving back to the place and the people
that helped make him the superstar he is. New York has a greater baseball
tradition than any other city, but we&#39;ve never had a player get all 3,000
hits in a New York uniform until today.

&#34;Congratulations Derek -- you&#39;ve made all of New York City proud.&#34;

Of the 27 other members of the 3,000 hits club, four had suited up for the
Yankees -- Boggs, Rickey Henderson, Paul Waner and Dave Winfield -- though no
player had recorded their 3,000th hit at Yankee Stadium, old or new.

&#34;I&#39;ve never seen it happen, so for me, it&#39;s pretty neat to watch,&#34; Yankees
manager Joe Girardi said. &#34;I was here in 1996 when he really started as an
everyday player, and to see what he&#39;s accomplished is pretty mind-boggling.
The amount of games he&#39;s played in, the playoff games, the playoff hits, the
big hits he&#39;s had. To see him get to this point is kind of special.&#34;

Entering the season 74 hits shy, Jeter arrived with high expectations and
considerable scrutiny and vowed to bounce back after enduring what he felt
was a subpar 2010 campaign with a career-low .270 batting average.

Armed with a new three-year, $51 million contract, Jeter said that pressing
for the milestone wouldn&#39;t be an issue. As he put it, &#34;Every time you&#39;re at
the plate, you want to get a hit.&#34;

Jeter&#39;s pursuit was halted for three weeks, six hits shy of the mark, when he
limped down the first-base line in a June 13 game against the Indians with a
strained right calf.

&#34;My focus was not on 3,000 hits, my focus was trying to get back on the
field,&#34; said Jeter, who returned to the lineup on Monday in Cleveland with a
hitless game.

Jeter notched two hits off the Tribe&#39;s Carlos Carrasco on Tuesday, belted an
eighth-inning double off Justin Masterson on Wednesday, and opened Thursday&#39;s
game with a two-base hit off the Rays&#39; Jeff Niemann.

Hit No. 2,999 came in the first inning of Saturday&#39;s game, a clean single
through the left side off Price, and Jeter doubled to left field in his third
at-bat of the game for career hit No. 3,001. Hit No. 4 on the day came in the
bottom of the sixth, an opposite-field single.

The 3,000th hit tied Jeter, baseball&#39;s active hits leader, with Roberto
Clemente for 27th place on the all-time list.

The 37-year-old is the sixth-youngest to 3,000, and enjoys select company in
that category behind Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Robin Yount, Pete Rose and Tris
Speaker. He is just the third shortstop to reach 3,000, behind Wagner and Cal
Ripken Jr.

&#34;This is my job. It&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve done, the only position I&#39;ve
played,&#34; Jeter said. &#34;I&#39;m proud of that. I&#39;m proud I&#39;m still playing.&#34;

Jeter&#39;s first career hit came on May 30, 1995, a single to left field off the
Seattle Mariners&#39; Tim Belcher in Jeter&#39;s second Major League game.

&#34;All I could think of was, &#39;If I don&#39;t get any hits, they&#39;re going to send me
out of here,&#39;&#34; Jeter recalled.

They never did. Jeter has reached the 200-hit plateau seven times in his
career, one shy of Lou Gehrig&#39;s franchise record and marking the most 200-hit
seasons by a shortstop.

Surpassing Gehrig (2,721) for the Yankees&#39; all-time franchise lead with a
Sept. 11, 2009 single off the Orioles&#39; Chris Tillman, Jeter&#39;s 3,000 hits have
run the gamut alphabetically off pitchers from David Aardsma to Joel Zumaya,
807 names in all.He has notched a hit off a pitcher wearing each of the other
29 big league uniforms.

The last player to join the 3,000 hits club was the Astros&#39; Craig Biggio, who
also amassed all of his hits with one club. Biggio logged No. 3,000 in 2007
and said Jeter has earned his way into that select group.

&#34;I think for Derek, in general, he&#39;s been such a great player and a great
role model for the game of baseball, where you&#39;re in that New York market and
it&#39;s one of the most difficult markets to work in,&#34; said Biggio. &#34;For him to
be able to play there and be the ambassador of the game he has been and be
such a great player, it&#39;s really says a lot about him. I&#39;m happy for him.&#34;
