Girardi was very impressed with Ben Sheets after meeting him yesterday. I
suppose he’d have to be, considering the Yankees plan to offer him between
$26 and $30 million.

On CC, he says that the lefty is still trying to figure out the whole
situation.Girardi then went on to talk about his own transition to New York
after the 1995 season, noting that while he wasn’t getting nearly the money
or years offered to Sabathia, he could understand what the free agent is going
through.

On Andy Pettitte, he said that both parties are interested in bringing him
back.But: “There’s a process that has to take place.” Emphasis mine.It seems
that line is bandied about frequently regarding Pettitte. Now that we know the
team’s offer is $10 million, it seems that “process” means “convincing him
to take a paycut.”

On the coaching staff: They won’t take long to mesh.He noted that
Mick Kelleher has been around Spring Training for a few years, and everyon&#39;s
familiar with him.Other than that, the staff remains basically the same,
save for a few minor moves.

On Hideki Matsui: Girardi sees him as a fourth outfielder as well as DH. I
wonder if that changes as they get further into workouts. Clearly, Hideki is
more valuable as a full-time DH if that means he can stay healthy. It’s a
huge risk if they play him in the outfield with any regularity.
