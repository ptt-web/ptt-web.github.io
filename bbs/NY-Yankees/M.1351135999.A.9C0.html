Press conference notes: Rivera, Pettitte, Cano, Nunez

Joe Girardi does an end-of-the-season press conference every year. It’s
standard procedure, and it’s worth doing if only to get the manager’s take
on several issues as the Yankees head into the offseason. Why was it so
mundane this year?

Because there’s no real mystery for Girardi to address.

The offensive struggles of the postseason went on long enough that Girardi
has already talked about them over and over again. Same for his handling of
Alex Rodriguez, his take on Derek Jeter’s ankle and his opinion about
whether certain players can be productive hitters when it counts. Anything
Girardi says about the future is largely speculative because he’s not the
final decision-maker.

“I believe we could have won a world championship with the players we had
this year, I do,” Girardi said. “We didn’t, but I believe we could have.
You look at Kuroda, he has to make a decision. Andy Pettitte needs to make a
decision. Soriano has an opt out. Swisher, we have to make a decision on him.
Granderson, we have to make a decision on. It just goes on and on and on.
Cano is on an option. There’s a lot of players that we have to decide what we
’re going to do, but I believe that when spring training starts next year, we
’ll be a championship caliber club.”

What does that mean? I don’t know, it’s an optimistic manager speaking with
optimism. It’s what we’ve come to expect from Girardi. There wasn’t much
he could tell us today, but given the circumstances, there was little reason
to expect anything else.

“There’s only going to be one team left standing when it’s over, so there’
s going to be a lot of disappointed teams,” Girardi said. “It’s not easy
for me to turn a baseball game on and watch it right now because I feel like
if we would have played to our capabilities, one of those teams could have
been us.”

前言很長 多半是一般的場面話 沒有太多特別的點 重點在以下

Here’s Girardi addressing a few other topics:

<span class="f2 hl">Is Mariano Rivera coming back next season?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Girardi said he hasn’t spoken to Rivera since the end of the year — and
</span><span class="f2 hl">even in spring training Girardi never asked whether Rivera wants to play next
</span><span class="f2 hl">season — but Girardi said his expectation is that he’ll have his closer
</span><span class="f2 hl">back.
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“From watching how he rehabbed, and everything that he was going through –
</span><span class="f2 hl"> picked up a baseball sooner than he was supposed to and got his hand smacked
</span><span class="f2 hl">a little bit – that would tell me that Mo probably wants to play,” Girardi
</span><span class="f2 hl">said. “But in saying that, it’s a decision that I think he’ll sit down with
</span><span class="f2 hl">his family, evaluate where he is maybe a little bit later in this process and
</span><span class="f2 hl">how he feels and how his arm feels, to feel like if he can compete at the level
</span><span class="f2 hl">he’s always competed at. But I don’t think that you push a rehab like he
</span><span class="f2 hl">pushed it unless you have some interest in possibly coming back.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉希望Mo能回來 但話說得很保守 端看Mo的復原進度而定
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Is Andy Pettitte coming back next season?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Similar story in that Girardi hasn’t asked Pettitte about his decision, but
</span><span class="f2 hl">unlike Rivera, Girardi seemed to have no sense one way or the other about
</span><span class="f2 hl">Pettitte’s future.
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“There’s a lot of hunger and fire in him, I know that,” Girardi said. “We
</span><span class="f2 hl">saw how he pushed himself to get back and to be a postseason and
</span><span class="f2 hl">down-the-stretch pitcher for us going out there where he had 65 pitches,
</span><span class="f2 hl">which is not normally something you do at this time of the year. I still
</span><span class="f2 hl">think the fire is there, but every year as you get a year older, you have to
</span><span class="f2 hl">ask yourself and your family, am I ready to give up eight months of my life.
</span><span class="f2 hl">That’s something that he’s going to have to ask himself.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉認為派帥的身心狀況都很ok 就看他自己想不想繼續再拼一年了
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">When will Girardi address his own contract situation?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Next year is the final year of Girardi’s current contract. He said he has no
</span><span class="f2 hl">plans of asking for an extension, and he’ll address the contract situation
</span><span class="f2 hl">at the end of next season. It’s the same thing he did last time he was in
</span><span class="f2 hl">the final year of a contract with the Yankees.
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“I expect it to be the same,” he said. “I don’t expect it to change, and
</span><span class="f2 hl">I don’t expect to ask to be changed. I understand. I understand how it works
</span><span class="f2 hl">here, and I’m okay with that. I’m expected to do my job, and if I do my
</span><span class="f2 hl">job, things take care of themselves.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉對於他自己的去留沒有什麼太大的評論 就希望維持現狀就好
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Does Robinson Cano need a lecture on hustle?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Many of you will be happy to know that Girardi did not dismiss the idea of
</span><span class="f2 hl">talking to Cano about the need to hustle more often, especially running hard
</span><span class="f2 hl">out of the box.
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“Robbie plays every day,” Girardi said. “We expect our players to play
</span><span class="f2 hl">hard, lead by example, and do those things. Sometimes frustration sets in.
</span><span class="f2 hl">Maybe you don’t run as hard as you should, and that’s learning how to
</span><span class="f2 hl">control your emotions. He had, for a little bit, a little tightness in his
</span><span class="f2 hl">hip where we had to bring him out of a game, and we addressed that. I will
</span><span class="f2 hl">address with every one of our players to play hard. You never know who’s
</span><span class="f2 hl">going to drop a popup, or boot a groundball, and put pressure on a team. But
</span><span class="f2 hl">sometimes frustration sets in, and that’s one of the things you have to
</span><span class="f2 hl">learn to manage.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">關於小Q被垢病的&#34;積極度&#34;問題
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉說會跟小Q 以及其他人重申&#34;努力打球&#34;的精神
</span><span class="f2 hl">不要因為情緒問題影響在球場上的積極度
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Will the Yankees bring Ichiro Suzuki back to the Bronx?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">This is the kind of question that’s most interesting heading into the
</span><span class="f2 hl">offseason, but it’s also the kind of question Girardi’s not really in a
</span><span class="f2 hl">position to answer.
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“This is a guy that had a lot of fun playing here,” Girardi said. “You see
</span><span class="f2 hl">it on a daily basis and seemed very happy here. Was great to be around, came
</span><span class="f2 hl">to play every day, played hard and made adjustments in his game to me because
</span><span class="f2 hl">we asked him to play left field, asked him to play center field. And he did
</span><span class="f2 hl">those things. He was a treat to be around. As far as what we’re going to do
</span><span class="f2 hl">as an organization, I can’t tell you that, but I enjoyed our time with him,
</span><span class="f2 hl">I really did.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉似乎對一朗很滿意 雖然他不能決定一朗會不會留下來
</span><span class="f2 hl">提到一朗配合度高 打球態度也很好
</span><span class="f2 hl">他看到一朗在洋基打球似乎打得頗開心 也很享受有一朗在洋基的日子
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">What’s the role of Eduardo Nunez going forward?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Nuned was one of the few sparks in the Yankees ALCS lineup, but Brian Cashman
</span><span class="f2 hl">has said he sees Nunez strictly as a shortstop, which creates real questions
</span><span class="f2 hl">about whether Nunez has a role with the Yankees next year.
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“It’s really hard to predict exactly what a guy’s role is going to be
</span><span class="f2 hl">right now, because we don’t know who’s on the team,” Girardi said. “But I
</span><span class="f2 hl">think this kid has something to offer us. I think we saw that in the Detroit
</span><span class="f2 hl">series. There is talent there. There is speed, there is excitement, there is
</span><span class="f2 hl">a guy who has the ability, I believe, to be a good shortstop. There is a lot
</span><span class="f2 hl">to offer. He brings energy, and I’d have to say he’s one of the favorites
</span><span class="f2 hl">in the clubhouse. The guys love him. But I’d say there’s talent there that
</span><span class="f2 hl">we’ll try to bring out in him as much as we can.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">關於E哥的定位
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉說他現在沒辦法確定 但E哥是個有衝勁 有態度 也有天份的小伙子
</span><span class="f2 hl">他相信E哥有能力去當一個好的SS 也會試著去幫助他成長
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Didn’t Yankee Stadium seem to lack energy in the postseason?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Girardi said the relatively quiet postseason crowds at Yankee Stadium could
</span><span class="f2 hl">be attributed to Yankees the lack of offense. If you were expecting the
</span><span class="f2 hl">manager — especially this manager — to rip the fans or question ticket
</span><span class="f2 hl">pricing, you’re crazy.
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“I think our fans are very passionate about the Yankees,” Girardi said. “
</span><span class="f2 hl">We see it on the road when we go on the road. They’re very passionate about
</span><span class="f2 hl">us winning. They like to see us score runs, and when you don’t score runs,
</span><span class="f2 hl">it seems like every (stadium) is quiet. There’s not a lot to get excited
</span><span class="f2 hl">about. You can get in some great pitchers duels where it’s 1-0, but nothing
</span><span class="f2 hl">excites a crowd like people running around the bases. That’s just the way it
</span><span class="f2 hl">is. We didn’t really have any big offensive explosions during the playoffs,
</span><span class="f2 hl">but I know I feel their love, I feel their passion and we feel their
</span><span class="f2 hl">disappointment too when we don’t accomplish the things that we want. I think
</span><span class="f2 hl">they’re tremendous.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">季後賽洋基球場球迷人數減少 氣氛低迷
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉覺得還是因為球隊自己沒打好 怎麼會去怪球迷沒給主場優勢呢?
