I’m about to head home from a predictably uneventful Joe Girardi press
conference. I’ll have more notes and nuggets when I get back to my apartment
and sort through everything, but there was nothing particularly revealing
that came from this morning’s half-hour session.

As you might expect, a significant amount of time was devoted to questions
about Alex Rodriguez.

(編按:相較於上篇落落長卻沒什麼話題性 這篇阿肉的可看性應該高多了XD)

<span class="f2 hl">Will Girardi have to repair his relationship with Rodriguez?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“Well, one of the things that I was taught as a boy and a young man is that
</span><span class="f2 hl">there’s a consequence for every action that takes place. Some of them are
</span><span class="f2 hl">going to be good. Some of them you’re going to have to deal with. I’m
</span><span class="f2 hl">always worried about whatever move I make, how it affects the club, how it
</span><span class="f2 hl">affects a player, anything. I think it’s something that, sure, I possibly
</span><span class="f2 hl">might have to deal with more than I expected, but I possibly might may not
</span><span class="f2 hl">have to deal with it at all. As we move forward, I’ll get a temperature on
</span><span class="f2 hl">it, keep track of it and see how it’s going.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉似乎不太想主動去修補和阿肉之間的關係
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Was Rodriguez fully healthy after he came back from the broken hand?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“I believe he was healthy, but if you look I believe, he had some struggles
</span><span class="f2 hl">in the course of the season as well, if you look at his numbers over the
</span><span class="f2 hl">whole season against right-handers. As players, sometimes you do have to make
</span><span class="f2 hl">minor adjustments and you have to say, ‘OK, let’s evaluate why maybe I wasn
</span><span class="f2 hl">’t as successful against right handers.’ And next year it could be
</span><span class="f2 hl">completely opposite. And then you look at that as well. As far as health, I
</span><span class="f2 hl">think he was healthy.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉認為阿肉是健康的 但是今年就是對右投打不好
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">Can Rodriguez be a prodictive hitter next year?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“Players have an opportunity, and when you’ve been a great player usually a
</span><span class="f2 hl">pretty smart player, sometimes you do have to make a tweak here or a tweak
</span><span class="f2 hl">there, or maybe you got away from what you were doing accidentally, and you
</span><span class="f2 hl">say, ok this is the reason this was happening or that was happening. So, can
</span><span class="f2 hl">Alex be a very good player again? Absolutely. I don’t have any question in
</span><span class="f2 hl">my mind, because I think the desire is there. As far as being a heads up
</span><span class="f2 hl">player, I think that’s there. As far as being a 45, 50 home run guy, we don’
</span><span class="f2 hl">t see much of that in baseball at all. How many guys hit 40-plus home runs
</span><span class="f2 hl">this year? Four, maybe five? So I don’t anticipate that’s going to happen,
</span><span class="f2 hl">but I think he can be a very good player.”
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">不過老吉還是相信阿肉明年會歸位的 畢竟他曾經是個頂尖球員
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">What does Rodriguez have to prove to the Yankees everyday third baseman next
</span><span class="f2 hl">year?
</span><span class="f2 hl">
</span><span class="f2 hl">“I expect Alex to be our everyday third baseman. What’s he going to have to
</span><span class="f2 hl">show me? That he’s healthy and ready to go, that’s the bottom line, that he
</span><span class="f2 hl">has no concerns and we have no concerns about putting him out there every day.
</span><span class="f2 hl">”
</span><span class="f2 hl">老吉還是會讓阿肉當先發的3B 前提是阿肉需要讓人看到一個健康且準備好的阿肉
