<span class="f2">※ 引述《wen8499 (wen)》之銘言：
</span>  簡單翻一下
<span class="f6">: Last week, it was announced that right-handed starting pitcher Roy Oswalt
</span><span class="f6">: requested a trade from the Houston Astros.
</span><span class="f6">: The three teams that were rumored to be the favorites for Oswalt were the
</span><span class="f6">: Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers. The Washington
</span><span class="f6">: Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers are believed to be interested as well.
</span><span class="f6">: However, some Yankee fans wondered and speculated if Oswalt would come to the
</span><span class="f6">: Yankees, or if they could get a decent package together worthy enough to get
</span><span class="f6">: Oswalt. One writer on here even did a column centering around a package that
</span><span class="f6">: included Javier Vazquez and prospects to get Oswalt, which many of you
</span><span class="f6">: thought of as unreasonable and unlikely, a feeling I shared as well.
</span>  自從上周推土機求去之後,勇士.紅雀.遊騎兵和道奇.國民都有興趣,那洋基有嗎?
<span class="f6">: Today, according to Sports Illustrated&#39;s Jon Heyman, the Yankees all but
</span><span class="f6">: killed any rumor of involving themselves in the Oswalt chase. Heyman said one
</span><span class="f6">: Yankees official told him that, &#34;we like our rotation the way it is right
</span><span class="f6">: now.&#34;
</span>  答案是否定的,洋基對現在的輪直感覺良好
<span class="f6">: It makes sense that the Yankees wouldn&#39;t need to pursue a starting pitcher
</span><span class="f6">: right now given how well their rotation has been.
</span><span class="f6">: Andy Pettitte is 6-1 with a 2.62 ERA, A.J. Burnett is 5-2 with a 3.55 ERA,
</span><span class="f6">: Phil Hughes is 5-1 with a 2.72 ERA, CC Sabathia is 4-3 with a 3.86 ERA and
</span><span class="f6">: Javier Vazquez is 3-4 with a 6.69 ERA (23-11 overall record for the five
</span><span class="f6">: Yankee starters).
</span><span class="f6">: A lot of people wondered if Vazquez was going to be removed from the rotation
</span><span class="f6">: after his 1-4 start, but he&#39;s been very strong in his last three outings, one
</span><span class="f6">: of which was a relief appearance against the Red Sox. In his last start, he
</span><span class="f6">: kept the Mets to one hit over six scoreless innings for his third win of 2010.
</span><span class="f6">: If Vazquez is starting to come around for the Yankees, then they really won&#39;t
</span><span class="f6">: need to pursue pitching, especially after they re-acquired Chad Gaudin
</span><span class="f6">: yesterday.  Gaudin will be in the bullpen for now, but can be an emergency
</span><span class="f6">: starter if needed.
</span>  有可能把JAVY+一些作物拿去換推土機嗎?似乎也不
<span class="f6">: With the Oswalt speculation out of the way, FOX Sports&#39; Ken Rosenthal did
</span><span class="f6">: bring up an interesting point in his story yesterday.
</span><span class="f6">: If and when Cliff Lee becomes a free agent, the Yankees would be more
</span><span class="f6">: interested in pursuing Lee after the 2010 season, rather than parting with
</span><span class="f6">: prospects right now in order to get Oswalt.
</span><span class="f6">: This tactic from the Yankees is nothing new, and if anything, it&#39;s a smart
</span><span class="f6">: one and the right move.
</span><span class="f6">: We know how well Cliff Lee can pitch in the American League and in the big
</span><span class="f6">: games. All you need to do is re-visit Games One and Five of the 2009 World
</span><span class="f6">: Series where Lee won both against the Yankees, and Game One was a
</span><span class="f6">: complete-game gem at Yankee Stadium.
</span><span class="f6">: We don&#39;t know how well Roy Oswalt would pitch in the American League and
</span><span class="f6">: especially in the American League Playoffs because he has spent his entire
</span><span class="f6">: career in the National League with Houston.
</span><span class="f6">: Since the Braves, Cardinals and Nationals came up, a lot of people feel like
</span><span class="f6">: Oswalt is more comfortable pitching in the National League, rather than
</span><span class="f6">: moving to the American League.
</span>  因為今年季後,Cliff Lee將變自由球員,一個曾經在美聯和大比賽證明過的投手,洋基
  對小李飛刀更有興趣,尤其洋基一貫的策略就是花大錢簽FA,而不讓作物過度流失
<span class="f6">: Plus, there have been multiple sources that have said that Oswalt doesn&#39;t
</span><span class="f6">: want to come to New York, whether it be with the Yankees or Mets.
</span><span class="f6">: Now, we are also two months away from the July 31 trading deadline. As of
</span><span class="f6">: right now, the Mariners, currently in last place of the A.L. West at 18-28,
</span><span class="f6">: are not shopping Lee. At least not right now, considering things can change
</span><span class="f6">: in two months.
</span><span class="f6">: If Lee did get dealt somewhere else, like the Dodgers, who have made
</span><span class="f6">: inquiries to Seattle, it could change things in the offseason, but a lot of
</span><span class="f6">: people feel that Lee will test the market to get a major payday before the
</span><span class="f6">: 2011 Season.
</span><span class="f6">: All of this seems like it&#39;s so far away since it&#39;s the end of May and
</span><span class="f6">: baseball season is only two months in, but given that this could very well be
</span><span class="f6">: Pettitte&#39;s last season and Vazquez will be a free agent next season, the
</span><span class="f6">: Yankees will be looking to replenish the rotation in the future.
</span><span class="f6">: They have done this thing before, such as when they decided to sign Sabathia
</span><span class="f6">: in free agency over trading for Johan Santana and then signing him long-term,
</span><span class="f6">: like the Mets had to do.
</span>  像不換山大王,而簽CC就是個例子
<span class="f6">: Right now, the sights of the Yankees is on the 2010 season. But deep
</span><span class="f6">: somewhere in the back of their head, Lee&#39;s availability is floating around.
</span><span class="f6">: <a href="http://0rz.tw/da5K7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://0rz.tw/da5K7</a>
</span>  結論:洋基現在對推土機沒興趣,有興趣的是季後FA的Lee
