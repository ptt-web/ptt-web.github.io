<span class="f3 hl">Biggest Winners</span>:


1. <span class="f3 hl">Detroit Tigers</span>

- Not only did they add Edgar Renteria to get their shortstop, but they

acquired Miguel Cabrera and Dontrelle Willis to give them one of the best

offenses in baseball. The bullpen is still weak, but the rotation and lineup

should allow for the bullpen to make a couple of errors here and there.

Obviously the Tigers went out to get a World Series and I would not be

surprised if they were back playing October ball this October. After acquiring

Willis and Cabrera, they locked up Willis, and are currently working on Miguel

Cabrera. Aside from them, they signed Granderson long term, and also acquired

Jacque Jones to play left field.


2. <span class="f3 hl">New York Mets</span>

- The Mets kept pretty quiet this off season after their heart breaking

collapse in the final weeks of the season. However, they played hard to get

with the Twins and finally pulled off a huge deal to land the best pitcher in

baseball, Johan Santana. Not only that, but they gave up four decent minor

league players who are still unproven. I do not think this locks up the

division, but it makes them a lot better than last season with just one major

addition. Other notable additions are Ryan Church and Brian Schneider, who

should adjust nicely to Shea Stadium after playing in D.C.


<span class="f0 hl">Biggest Losers</span>:


1. <span class="f0 hl">Minnesota Twins</span>

- Yes the Twins were able to unload Johan Santana but did not get anything in

return that will help them significantly in 2008. If they had taken an earlier

offer, they could have had Jacoby Ellsbury and four other prospects that were a

lot better than the ones they got. With the trade, they have no number one

starter with Liriano still in question and although they landed Delmon Young,

did nothing to improve their infield by signing Mike Lamb and Adam Everett. In

the division they are in now, I think they will be fighting for third, possible

fourth if the Royals turn it around.


2. <span class="f0 hl">St. Louis Cardinals</span>

- Just a year after winning the World Series, the Cardinals finished in third

place. They had no pitching, and did nothing this off season to improve that.

Yes they added Matt Clement, but he has not pitched successfully in two seasons

. Cesar Izturis is not the answer at shortstop, and hopefully Troy Glaus can

perform at third. Who knows if Ankiel can repeat his impressive numbers now

moving to center, and who is playing right field again? Skip Schumaker, or the

rookie Colby Rasmus.


Honorable Mention: <span class="f0 hl">Scott Boras</span>


<span class="f6 hl">Best Signing</span>:


1. <span class="f6 hl">Andruw Jones, Dodgers</span>

- To sign Andruw Jones to a two year deal worth 36.2 million dollars does not

seem like a good signing considering he hit .222 with 26 HR, but that was

obviously a fluke. He had 50 HR just two seasons ago. Yes, we can see his is on

the decline but he still has two solid years left and if Dodger pitching can

hold the line, I think they will be up for a playoff bid.


<span class="f4 hl">Worst Signing</span>:


1. <span class="f4 hl">Mariano Rivera</span>

- Mariano Rivera is one of the best closers in the history of the game, but in

no way did he deserve a three year deal. I am going to avoid the money and the

type of player he is for one second. The Yankees are an old team and in order

to compete with the Yankees, need to get younger. Signing him to a one year

deal or even two year deal would allow them to go out and try and land someone

like Joe Nathan or Francisco Rodriguez in the next off season. Instead, they

are stuck with the closer who is expected to struggle.


2. <span class="f4 hl">Aaron Rowand</span>

- For the Giants, they are in no position to be injury prone players. The

Giants are a last place team and keep signing players when they should be

trading the good players they have left for younger players with better

potential. Just not a smart signing on the Giants part.


<span class="f1 hl">Best Trade</span>: <span class="f1 hl">Athletics traded OF Nick Swisher to the Chicago White Sox for LHP</span>

<span class="f1 hl">Gio Gonzalez, RHP Fautino De Los Santos and OF Ryan Sweeney.</span>

- Wow. What a move by the A&#39;s. Not only did they acquire three solid prospects

but they got rid of a decent player locked up for a long time. Don&#39;t get me

wrong, I think that Swisher can perform, but not enough to help the A&#39;s. The

White Sox traded away three players key to their future for one player who may

or may not help. Big win for A&#39;s.
