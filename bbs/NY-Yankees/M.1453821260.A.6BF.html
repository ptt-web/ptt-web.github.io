1) Gary Sanchez, C, Grade B+: Age 23, hit .274/.330/.485 with 18 homers, 29
walks, 78 strikeouts in 365 at-bats in Double-A/Triple-A, threw out 37% of
stealers with significant reductions in passed ball and error rates as
receiving improved. Can stay behind the plate, getting to his power more
often, and seems to have matured emotionally after previous problems.

2) Jorge Mateo, SS, Grade B+: Age 20, hit .278/.345/.392 between Low-A and
High-A with strong run late (.321/.374/.452 for Tampa), stole 82 bases, 43/98
BB/K in 449 at-bats. Top-shelf speed and uses it well, may or may not develop
more power, tools fit at shortstop but needs more polish as you’d expect
given his age. You can make a good case to rank him ahead of Sanchez and I
may ultimately do so when the Top 150 prospects list comes out in March.

3) Aaron Judge, OF, Grade B+/B: Age 23 (24 in April), hit .284/.350/.516 with
12 homers in 250 at-bats in Double-A then .224/.308/.373 with eight homers in
228 at-bats in Triple-A. Huge 6-7 wingspan and the power to match, has some
pure hitting skills though Triple-A pitchers were able to contain him more
often than not, an under-rated fielder. Impact power but still uncertain what
his batting average and OBP will look like.

4) James Kaprielian, RHP, Grade B+/B: Age 21 (22 in March), first round pick
out of UCLA, ace of the staff there, good curve, good slider, good change-up,
throws strikes, main question revolves around fastball which was 88-92 in
college but hit 93-96 in the New York-Penn League. Very polished; an Aaron
Nola-like rapid rise is possible under the right conditions.

5) Domingo Acevedo, RHP, Grade B: Age 21, posted 1.69 ERA with 53/15 K/BB in
48 innings in New York-Penn League, huge guy (6-6, 240) with huge fastball
(95-100 MPH, peaking at 102-103 according to some reports), good change-up,
breaking ball is inconsistent. Questions about command and long-term role,
could be dominant ace-type if breaking ball comes along, perhaps a closer if
it doesn’t.

6) Rob Refsnyder, 2B, Grade B-/B: Age 24, hit .271/.359/.401 in Triple-A then
.302/.348/.512 in 43 major league at-bats. Not toolsy but knows how to play,
solid hitter with surprising pop and decent strike zone judgment, main
problem is finding a place in the lineup given mediocre glove at second base.
Has college experience in the outfield, could be versatile roster asset with
nice bat.

7) Wilkerman Garcia, SS, Grade B-: Age 17, hit .281/.396/.347 with 25 walks,
19 strikeouts in 121 at-bats in Gulf Coast League, signed for $1,350,000 in
2014 as part of huge Yankees international class, definitely the most
advanced of the lot at this point as several of the others (notably Dermis
Garcia, Juan De Leon) have been disappointing or mediocre so far. Wilkerman
shows excellent strike zone judgment, runs well, may develop some power, has
tools for shortstop but needs experience. Could plausibly be at the top of
this list within 12 months.

8) Dustin Fowler, OF, Grade B-/C+: Age 21, hit .307/.340/.419 in High-A then
.289/.328/.370 in Double-A, stole 30 bases. Good athlete with nice swing from
left side, speed, good reviews for his defense, main question is power
projection. Some risk of tweenerdom and more likely a role player, albeit a
good one, than a regular in my view.

9) Kyle Holder, SS, Grade B-/C+: Age 21, first round pick in 2015 from
University of San Diego, hit disappointing .213/.273/.253 in New York-Penn
League. Fine athlete and major league-ready with the glove, could be Gold
Glove eventually if he hits enough to play regularly, which is a serious
question. Makes contact but lack of power was a big problem in NY-P.

10) Ian Clarkin, LHP, Grade B-/C+: Age 20, missed season with sore elbow but
pitched in Arizona Fall League and looked rusty. When healthy, throws strikes
with lively fastball, curve, change combination and looks like a number three
starter, maybe more. Big question is durability.

11) Jacob Lindgren, LHP, Grade C+/B-: Age 22, hard-thrower was in the majors
within a year of being drafted out of Mississippi State, closer potential but
went down in June with bone spurs. Command, durability key concerns.

ANALYST NOTE: Grade C+ prospects in the 12-20 slots can be ordered in many
different ways with good logic. Consider this more of a tiered approach in
comparison to the top 11 rather than an exact ordering.

12) Tyler Wade, INF, Grade C+: Age 21, hit .280/.349/.353 with 31 steals in
368 at-bats in High-A but just .204/.224/.265 in 113 at-bats in Double-A,
strike zone got away from him at higher levels (two walks, 24 strikeouts).
One of many interesting infielders but lacks the ultimate ceiling of Mateo or
Garcia, doesn’t have Holder’s glove or Refsnyder’s bat. Best attribute is
speed.

13) Abiatal Avelino, INF, Grade C+: Age 20, hit .252/.309/.321 with 38 steals
in High-A, best attribute is defense, solid at shortstop and excellent at
second base, steals more on instinct than pure speed. Like Wade, he is very
interesting but doesn’t have the broad skill base of Mateo or Garcia.

14) Mason Williams, OF, Grade C+: Age 24, just as everyone was giving up on
him he turned career around with .318/.397/.398 run through high minors,
promoted to majors, played eight games (.286/.318/.571) then hurt his
shoulder. Skills looked much better until the injury. Attitude questions have
been his biggest problem, not tools. Impossible to predict, your guess is as
good as anyone else’s. My guess is that he’s a fourth outfielder.

15) Ben Gamel, OF, Grade C+: Age 23, breakout season in Triple-A with
.300/.358/.472 line, 28 doubles, 14 triples, 10 homers, 13 steals, 46 walks,
108 strikeouts in 500 at-bats. Has never hit like this before although scouts
have respected his swing since high school and he has bloodlines as Matt Gamel
’s younger brother. Does not have Williams’ athletic gifts but could have
similar value as fourth outfielder.

16) Drew Finley, RHP, Grade C+: Age 19, third round pick in 2015 from San
Diego high school, posted 3.94 ERA with 41/19 K/BB in 32 innings in Appy
League. Advanced curveball and change-up for his age, fastball average at his
point but may pick up, good reputation for makeup, pitchability.

17) Hoy Jun Park, SS, Grade C+: Age 19, hit .239/.351/.383 with 12 steals, 34
walks, 50 strikeouts in 222 at-bats in Appy League. $1,000,000 signing out of
Korea, another guy with shortstop tools and fairly polished for his age,
lacks strength with the bat but showed a decent eye, has potential to improve
as a hitter.

18) Cale Coshow, RHP, Grade C+: Age 23, easy to miss as season was split
between three levels but posted combined 2.45 ERA with 97/28 K/BB in 114
innings, 85 hits, finished well in Double-A. 94-97 fastball, some reports at
99-100, plus slider as well, command took a step forward. Change-up needs
more work, huge guy at 6-5, 260. Intriguing sleeper prospect.

19) Miguel Andujar, 3B, Grade C+: Age 20, hit .243/.288/.363 in High-A, which
was league-average production for power-starved Florida State League. Season
was virtually identical to Low-A campaign in 2014, including cold start, hot
finish, and erratic defense. Hard to give up on very strong arm at third base
but needs a lot of polish.

20) Luis Torrens, C, Grade C+: Age 19, missed season with labrum tear, tough
injury for a catcher. Before injury showed above-average tools as both hitter
and defender but we need to see how his recovery looks in the spring.

OTHER GRADE C+: Chance Adams, RHP; Jeff Degano, LHP; Jordan Montgomery, LHP;
Nick Rumbelow, RHP

OTHERS OF NOTE: Trey Amburgey, OF; Luis Cessa, RHP; Domingo German, RHP;
Isiah Gilliam, OF-1B; Nick Goody, RHP; Chad Green, RHP; Slade Heathcott, OF;
Jhalan Jackson, OF; Brady Lail, RHP; James Pazos, LHP; Carlos Vidal, OF
