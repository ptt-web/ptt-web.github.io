BOSTON -- Less than three weeks after Alex Rodriguez crossed over Dallas
Braden&#39;s mound and dismissed him as &#34;a guy who has a handful of wins in his
career,&#34; the Yankees slugger tipped his cap to the left-hander&#39;s biggest
victory of them all.

Braden pitched the 19th perfect game in Major League history on Sunday, in a
4-0 blanking of the Rays, needing just 109 pitches to retire all 27 Tampa Bay
batters.

Rodriguez opened the weekend at Fenway Park by saying that he would not be
drawn further into a war of words with Braden, who had criticized A-Rod again
in a recent interview with the A&#39;s. He then prepared to close the three-game
series against the Red Sox by praising him.

&#34;I&#39;ve learned in my career that it&#39;s always better to be recognized for some
of the great things you do on the field,&#34; Rodriguez said in a brief statement
during batting practice. &#34;Good for him. He threw a perfect game, and even
better he beat the Rays.&#34;

The perfecto bid was a topic of discussion during Yankees manager Joe
Girardi&#39;s pre-game availability with reporters, some of whom were checking
for updates on their wireless phones.

&#34;I hope he gets it,&#34; Girardi said, as Braden prepared to head into the ninth
inning. &#34;A perfect game is an amazing feat. I&#39;ve had the chance to watch one
and catch one. I don&#39;t have any hard feelings toward Dallas Braden.

&#34;As I&#39;ve said, there&#39;s a competitive edge to people, and we don&#39;t play them
until July [5-7], so I&#39;m not really worried about it. You know, I hope he
gets it. God bless him.&#34;

The fact that the perfect game would come against the Rays, a team the
Yankees trailed by a half game in the American League East entering play on
Sunday, was an added bonus.

&#34;That always helps too, being within our division,&#34; Girardi said, with a
chuckle.

Behind closed doors, the Yankees had largely found humor in Braden&#39;s claims
that A-Rod violated an unwritten code of baseball on April 22, when he passed
over the mound on his way back to first base following a foul ball.

Braden shouted at Rodriguez during and after that inning, then continued the
discussion later that evening through the media. The next day, Rodriguez said
that he found the whole hubbub &#34;pretty funny&#34; and that &#34;we&#39;ve been laughing
about it since.&#34;

Some still were. As he prepared for his start Sunday at Fenway, Yankees
starter A.J. Burnett spotted highlights of Braden hugging his grandmother,
Peggy Lindsey, who was present for the perfect game in Oakland.

&#34;Grandma, I love you, but don&#39;t cross my mound!&#34; Burnett cracked.
