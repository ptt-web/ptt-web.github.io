One way or the other, Matt Duran&#39;s baseball future is going to hinge on
playing in The Bronx.

Duran, a New Rochelle High School player who is committed to Fordham, was
drafted by the Yankees with their fourth round pick Tuesday afternoon. Listed
by the Yankees as a third baseman, Duran was the 23rd best prospect in New
York, according to Baseball America, and outside of its top 200.

The site doesn&#39;t have a profile up of Duran, who was a member of Hank&#39;s
Yanks, a team sponsored by Yankees co-owner Hank Steinbrenner.

Fordham University does on its website, though, and here it is:

Duran, a 6-1 infielder from New Rochelle, New York, is a four-year varsity
baseball player at New Rochelle High School. He is a two-time All-League
selection, and was named to the All-Section team as a junior, when he also
garnered team MVP honors.

He was rated by Perfect Game USA as a top national prospect, and was
selected Second Team All-Star for Lo-Hud baseball by The Journal News.
In addition to playing for New Rochelle, Duran plays for Hank&#39;s Yanks,
a team sponsored by Hank Steinbrenner, General Partner of the New York
Yankees, and the New York Yankees area code team, for which he hit .300
during the Area Code Games in California, which has grown into one of the
highest regarded high school talent tournaments in the country.

A nominee for the National Honor Society, he also participated in the
Empire State Games this past summer, hitting .450 with nine RBI.
