2nd Round 88pick LHP Sam Stafford

Scouting Update: Sam Stafford, LHP (Texas/Santa Barbara Foresters)
By John Klima

The New York Yankees selected Sam Stafford, a left-handed pitcher from the
University of Texas, in the second round of the 2011 MLB Draft on Tuesday
(the 88th overall selection). Stafford is a 6-foot-4, 200-pound junior.

I had a very good look at University of Texas left-hander Sam Stafford
recently, in an outing in which he pitched seven no-hit innings and showed
Friday night stuff on a seriously hot Thursday.

The first thing you would absolutely notice about Stafford is the overhand
12/6 curveball with true bite, power, and plane and the complete and total
confidence he has to throw the pitch at any time in the count. Stafford likes
to mix and match and its clear that he doesn’t stay true to one pattern. The
curveball was 76-78 for hard strikes in this look, in which I graded the
rotation and command above average.

Stafford has the arm power to be a front line left-handed starter. I had his
fastball at 91-94, including peaks at 94 into the seventh inning. Stafford
averaged 91-92 with the fastball and I graded his command above average,
specifically with the ability to cut the plate in half and make good use of
his slider, which was 81-85 in this look, and with hard life.

In many cases, a left-hander often has to decide which pitch is better for
him, be it the curveball or the slider, because too many times one usually
takes away from the other. In this look, Stafford’s stuff was so sharp that
he was capable of incorporating all three pitches in and attaining various
looks and angles.

His slider had the arm action run on right-handers and changed planes from a
differing angle than the curveball. I’m sure Stafford, like every other
left-hander I’ve ever talked with in my life, wishes both pitches worked as
well each time out. This was one of those times, but what you like is the
idea that he has enough weapons to compete at the advanced levels when he
reaches into the bag and maybe only two of the pitches are really there
for him on a given night.

Built with medium hips, broad shoulders, long legs, Stafford has a loose and
whippy arm action and exactly the right arm speed he needs to be what he is.
He remains balanced and coordinated and closed, lands well, and pitched with
poise. I liked the way the ball came out of his hand. He repeated well.

The one pitch he told me he was working on was the change-up, which of course,
most high school and college coaches don’t let guys throw against metal. I’
ve seen it go both ways – some guys have enough confidence in the change to
throw it against metal and some put it away.

In Stafford’s case, he was just working on a straight change.
That would be a below-average pitch at this point, but that’s OK, and I
could argue that he had a very good feel for it despite not throwing it very
much.

It should grade up and here’s why – good understanding of maintaining arm
slot, arm speed and deception. It needs more innings but you can envision it
becoming a part of the palate, and the creation of a four-pitch major league
starter.
