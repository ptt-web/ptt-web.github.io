  As the Yanks head into Spring Training, they may or may not have a roster

  with too many outfielders for too few spaces. Johnny Damon is entrenched in

  left field and the lead-off spot while Brett Gardner and Melky Cabrera will

  seemingly battle it out for center field. In right, Nick Swisher and Xavier

  Nady offer the Yanks a plethora of platoon options with Hideki Matsui as the

  DH.

  The Yanks could look to trade an outfielder. Damon wouldn’t — and probably

  shouldn’t — be the one to go while no team would take on Hideki without a

  guarantee that his knees could hold up. So that leaves Swisher and Nady as

  the potential trade bait. Swisher had a seemingly poor 2008, but luck had a

  big role in suppressing his numbers. He also has a better track record than

  Nady.

  But no one seems to generate more discussion than Nady as the Yanks shop

  their outfielders. In answering some mail this week, Steve Goldman opined

  about Nady:

  What happened to the Yankees’ fondness of Xavier Nady? It seemed like when

  they got him, the organization really liked him. But now they’re thinking of

  trading him? Trading away a .305 AVG, 25 HR and 97 RBI from an offense that

  had trouble scoring runs last year? Does that even make sense? –Tucker

  It makes a ton of sense, Tucker, because Nady isn’t really a .305 hitter. In

  his career, he’s been far closer to the hitter he cooled from his hot

  pinstriped start, a .268/.320/.474 hitter. As far as corner outfield

  production goes, it’s subpar. If Nick Swisher gets back on track this year,

  he’ll get on base much closer to 40 percent of the time and show comparable

  power. The value in Nady last season was that he was a huge in-season upgrade

  on Melky Cabrera, who he displaced from the lineup by allowing Johnny Damon

  to go back to center. That was a very nice move by Brian Cashman to staunch a

  bleeding wound, but Nady isn’t someone a championship team plans on

  starting.

  Meanwhile, one of the various Steve’s who read RAB wrote in with this take

  on the X Man:

  He’s one of the more misunderstood players on the Yanks, with many believing

 “he had a fluke year” and “he’s a NL player,” both of which are

  demonstrably false.

  Check out the progression Nady has made over the past 5 years, especially vs

  righties. (The numbers are BA/OBP/SLG/OPS.)

  2004
        AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS

  vs R .178 .213 .311 .524

  vs L .344 .417 .563 .979

  2005

  vs R .223 .270 .431 .700

  vs L .323 .400 .452 .852

  2006

  vs R .263 .312 .424 .736

  vs L .336 .418 .551 .969

  2007

  vs R .274 .322 .479 .802

  vs L .295 .356 .463 .819

  2008

  vs R .317 .357 .529 .886

  vs L .262 .361 .444 .805

  He has steadily improved from being a platoon player who only hit lefties, to

  one who hit righties better than lefties last season. Even if that was a peak

  year for him, if he was to revert to his 2007 line he would still be a fine

  everyday player and a good replacement for Abreu, especially when you factor

  in his value as a (slightly better than league average) fielder, and Abreu

  being the worst RF in the AL by most measures.

  Now to the AL/NL stuff:

  2007

  1st Half .291 .344 .504 .848

  2nd Half .255 .303 .425 .728

  2008

  1st Half .321 .377 .525 .901

  2nd Half .284 .333 .492 .825

  The middling second half he had leads many Yankee fans to believe that he’s

 “not an AL player,” but he actually had a similarly weak (.80 drop off in

  OPS both years) 2nd half in 2007 in the NL, which could say something about

  his conditioning or training regimen, but not the league. It’s also worth

  noting that he only became a full time player in 2008 (607 PAs), he had about

  500 PAs in 2007/2006 and 356 PAs in 2005. Again, he is progressing from a

  platoon player to an everyday player.

  So what will it be? Should the Yankees trade Xavier Nady? I’d be inclined to

  keep him as a fourth outfielder, long his traditional role, and if Swisher

  falters, they have a Plan B. He provides a lot of pop off the bench, and the

  Yanks don’t need to trade him right now.

  Let’s open the floor on this debate with an ever-popular poll, and feel free

  to use this post as tonight’s open thread.
