<span class="f3 hl">Will Yankee dollars put Sabathia in a New York state of mind?</span>

There’s really not much new in this Jon Heyman column. Will Sabathia go for
home or money? Yeah, no one has a clue. He does talk to a friend of Sabathia,
though. Plenty of reporters have seemingly done that this year, asking random
Sabathia friend after random Sabathia friend about the pitcher’s intentions.
Most of them, it seems, feel he’ll go home. The friend Heyman tracked down:
Jimmy Rollins. His take: “New York, American League. They’ve got enough
money, and they need him.”


<span class="f3 hl">Holliday shopping for Yankees</span>

The Yankees have been tied to just about every major free agent and available
star this winter. But one top player who has yet to be linked to the Yankees
but definitely intrigues them is Matt Holliday.

Rockies management likes Holliday a lot, too, but has determined that it will
try to trade him and, in fact, expects to trade him. Colorado is willing to
go five years for Holliday but believes he&#39;s interested in a deal for closer
to eight years or perhaps even longer.

Yankees people have heard good things about Holliday. However, their one
concern is his home-road splits, which show he has been more successful at
Coors Field than on the road. This year the difference was minimal, as
Holliday hit .332 with 15 home runs at home, .308 with 10 home runs on the
road. But his lifetime numbers reflect a significant variation. He&#39;s a .357
career hitter at Coors Field, with 84 home runs. On the road he is a .280
hitter with 44 home runs.


<span class="f3 hl">Cashman was warned about Mariners honcho</span>

Brian Cashman is still a Yankee in part because of Gillick&#39;s stories about
working for the current Mariners regime. Gillick told Cashman for years what
it was like to answer to Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln, and Cashman is said to
have never seriously considered going there in part because of those stories.

The Mariners&#39; hiring of Jack Zduriencik as GM is an inspired call, though.
It&#39;s somewhat surprising to see someone who&#39;s 57 get his first GM job, but it
may reflect some new hesitancy on the part of some to go for another young
Ivy League stat man. Zduriencik is the longtime scout responsible for
fortifying the Brewers&#39; reservoir of young talent, an impressive enough stash
that no one else really had a chance to land Sabathia at mid-year.
