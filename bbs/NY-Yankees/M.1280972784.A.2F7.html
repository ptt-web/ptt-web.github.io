Stadium employee grabs No. 600

Babilonia returns keepsake to A-Rod in exchange for signed bat



NEW YORK -- Frankie Babilonia was just filling in for a co-worker. The Yankee
Stadium security guard, who typically patrols center field in Section 000,
was slotted to spell a stadium employee in Monument Park for 30 minutes
around 1:30 p.m. ET.

But Babilonia, 23, never imagined that those 30 minutes would ultimately
unfold into the greatest half-hour of his life.

When Rodriguez launched Shaun Marcum&#39;s 85-mph fastball into Monument Park,
Babilonia inherited the responsibility of retrieving the slugger&#39;s 600th
career home run ball and personally returning it to the Yankees&#39; third
baseman.

And the security guard was clearly star-struck during his encounter with
Rodriguez. Following the Yankees&#39; 5-1 victory over the Blue Jays, Babilonia
looked visibly nervous as he received an autographed baseball bat from the
slugger.

&#34;I&#39;m at a loss for words,&#34; Babilonia said after handing Rodriguez the ball.
&#34;It was a lifetime experience. I&#39;ll never forget this. Later on in the years,
if I ever have children, I&#39;ll let them know I was the one that caught the 600
ball and handed it back in.&#34;

Rodriguez, however, also felt fortunate. During his postgame press
conference, the seventh member of the Major Leagues&#39; 600-home run club
acknowledged that the 23-year-old could have snagged the ball, which prompted
him to praise Babilonia&#39;s altruistic approach.

&#34;I feel very blessed, very lucky that Frankie was so generous,&#34; Rodriguez
said. &#34;[Media relations director] Jason Zillo had a master plan to try to get
the ball back and tie it back into charity somehow.&#34;

Babilonia, of course, had no plans to steal the ball. Prior to the game, the
security guard&#39;s boss informed all of his employees that they would be
required to return Rodriguez&#39;s milestone ball. And Babilonia planned to
follow protocol.

&#34;I like doing my job,&#34; Babilonia said. &#34;I don&#39;t want to put my job at risk at
all. My job was to retrieve the ball and return it to my superiors, and
that&#39;s what I did. I like doing my job. That&#39;s what I did.&#34;

Once Babilonia collected the ball from Monument Park, he declined to protect
it in his pocket, opting instead to carefully carry the historical item with
both hands.

Babilonia was ultimately rewarded for his noble endeavor. Facing dozens of
reporters after the game, he showcased his autographed bat by A-Rod and said
he planned to store his prized piece in a glass case at home.

Until he straightens that out, though, Babilonia is just anticipating the
after-effects of his new-found celebrity status.

&#34;My phone is probably blowing up right now,&#34; Babilonia said. &#34;I just hope a
lot of people aren&#39;t at my door, knocking and all of this.&#34;

As for his co-worker?

&#34;I guess he&#39;s pretty mad,&#34; Babilonia said, laughing.

簡單的說...一位代班(真幸運..)的23歲工作人員Frankie Babilonia撿了這顆球

親手還給了A-Rod  得到簽名球棒

(NYY官網上的影片找的到Frankie拿著球棒跟A-Rod的合影

在A-Rod 16分鐘記者會影片的最後三分鐘)

他應該一夕成名了XD


<span class="f2">※ 引述《Scape (non)》之銘言：
</span><span class="f6">: 這球是打到中外野沒有球迷坐的地方
</span><span class="f6">: 所以工作人員撿走了
</span><span class="f6">: 但是印象中曾經有球迷跑進中外野那塊黑色的區域撿全壘打球
</span><span class="f6">: 若今天有球迷奮不顧身跳進網子內撿600轟
</span><span class="f6">: 被請出球場我想是一定的
</span><span class="f6">: 但是那顆球的所有權會是誰的呢??
</span><span class="f6">: 球場的安全人員有權利直接把600轟那顆球直接拿走嗎??
</span><span class="f6">: 請教一下有看過這類爭議如何處理的板友 球團的做法會是如何?
</span><span class="f6">: 直接搶過來會侵犯到那位違規撿球觀眾的權益嗎??
</span><span class="f6">: PS:是我的話我就很想跳進去撿那顆球...
