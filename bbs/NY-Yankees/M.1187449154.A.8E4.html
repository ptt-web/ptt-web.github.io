Flu bug? What flu bug?

The Yankees had a sign posted in their clubhouse Thursday afternoon warning
players against interacting with members of the Detroit Tigers, for reasons
that had nothing to do with the icy state of affairs between Gary Sheffield
and Joe Torre.

No, the flu bug has hit the Tigers hard, even though threat of airborne
illness didn&#39;t keep reporters away from Sheffield&#39;s locker before the
game. (Sheffield essentially insisted he wasn&#39;t backing off his earlier
quotes; Torre wanted nothing to do with Sheffield or the questions,
except to say that Sheffield always played hard as a Yankee.)

Influenza or not, the Tigers haven&#39;t looked anything like a bunch of
stragglers trying to stay home from school. Detroit took advantage of
a spotty Mike Mussina performance, with Carlos Guillen clubbing a grand slam
in the first inning and sending the right-hander out with seven runs
(six earned) on his tab after five innings.

Sheffield has been rudely welcomed tonight in the Bronx, though he&#39;s had
some company. The sellout crowd on hand has seen a letdown, not expecting
to witness Kyle Farnsworth pitching in the sixth inning. The usual
reception ensued, as well as a similar one when Pudge Rodriguez took
Ron Villone deep in the seventh. Even the secret weapon, Shelley Duncan,
couldn&#39;t replicate his magic in a big sixth-inning spot, striking out
with two men on. Couldn&#39;t expect a homer every time.

Jason Giambi is relieved not to be suspended, by the way. He&#39;s also playing
first base tonight and even made a diving stop. No joke.
