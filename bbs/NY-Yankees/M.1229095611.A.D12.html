I called Yankees farm director Mark Newman this afternoon looking for comments
on the four players taken in the major league portion of the Rule 5 draft,
but you&#39;ll probably be more interested in a few of the smaller notes I
gathered from our brief conversation.

1. Frank Cervelli will most likely open the season back in Trenton.
Triple-A hasn&#39;t been ruled out, but &#34;more likely Double-A,&#34; Newman said.
That seems to suggest the Yankees will be back in market for a veteran catcher
to play in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. My guess is P.J. Pilittere would then be on
the Triple-A bench with Kyle Anson playing behind Cervelli in Trenton,but
that&#39;s only speculation.All Newman said was that Cervelli is most likely going
to Double-A.
2. Forget about Damon Sublett jumping straight to Trenton. Newman shot that
down quickly. &#34;He&#39;s looking at Tampa right now,&#34; Newman said.
3. The plan is for Jesus Montero and Austin Romine to stay together at the
start of 2009. Not sure about a mid-season promotion for one or the other,
but they should be together on opening day.
4. Doug Bernier will play all over the field in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, &#34;Not
unlike Cody Ransom last year,&#34; Newman said.
5. For now the Yankees also have Chris Malec and Kevin Russo (right) penciled
into the Triple-A infield, but that could change. &#34;Right now they&#39;re both
slated to go there,&#34; Newman said. &#34;But we&#39;ll see what happenes. Somebody
could end up in Trenton. It&#39;s going to be a game-time decision as they say,
end of spring training.&#34;
6. The infield logjam goes beyond Triple-A. I asked if some of the other
infielders -- I specifically brought up Mitch Hilligoss and Justin Snyder --
might see time in the outfield next season. Snyder has experience out there,
but Newman didn&#39;t commit one way or the other. &#34;That&#39;s always possible,&#34; he
said. &#34;If they swing the bat well enough to deserve at-bats, then you find a
place to play them.&#34;
7. I asked about J.B. Cox who had a minor injury late last season and never
returned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. I thought he might have been hurt more
seriously than orginally indicated, but Newman said Cox is healthy and
throwing.

Otherwise, Newman&#39;s take on the Rule 5 was pretty much what you&#39;d expect. He
said the Yankees had Jason Jones, Zack Kroenke and Reegie Corona tentatively
schedule for Triple-A, but that could obviously have changed between now and
spring training.

&#34;We&#39;ve got talent in the system,&#34; Newman said. &#34;We were hoping it wouldn&#39;t be
four, but it is. We had 40 guys on the major league roster so it&#39;s not like
we had open spots.&#34;
