Q:
About Joba Chamberlain… I wonder how much of his current troubles with
consistency are due to the inconsistencies in his role, shifting from starter
to reliever and back, then back again. I can’t remember any pitcher being
moved back and forth so many times, aside from spot starters/long relievers
of the Ramiro Mendoza mold, but that’s not the same. I personally have
always been in the “Joba is a starter” crowd, and I still think he could be
a top notch starter as he’s still young, has great stuff, and has been
healthy. I think next year he should become a full time starter (yes, even
though it’s another change, at least it will be the last), possibly starting
in AAA to rebuild his mojo (if necessary), then set him loose on the AL and
hope it works. Thoughts? – Howie



A:(by Mike Axisa)
The Blue Jays really screwed around (bouncing back-and-forth between the
rotation and bullpen) with both Dustin McGowan and Brandon League earlier in
their careers, particularly McGowan. He hasn’t thrown a pitch in the big
leagues in 742 days because of major reconstructive shoulder surgery, and he
recently had another setback. I’m not saying the juggling act led to McGowan
’s injury though, not at all. He threw 80.1 more innings in 2007 than he did
in 2006, when he was still just 25-year-old. That’s the likely culprit

Anyway, back to Joba. I definitely think the constant changing of roles has
impacted him in a negative way. There’s nothing wrong with shifting a player
to the bullpen at the end of the season, but going from reliever to starter
and having that transition take place in meaningful games is tough. Also,
while well-intentioned, the 2009 Joba Rules were horrifyingly stupid. The
fact that the Yankees aren’t doing the same thing to Phil Hughes this season
is basically an acknowledgment of that stupidity. Joba definitely had a deer
in the headlights look towards the end of last season, like he didn’t know
if he was coming or going, looking over his shoulder at the bullpen wondering
if this was going to be his last batter.

That said, I don’t think Joba is beyond repair. I’ve given up on him being
a starter not because I don’t think he can do, just because I don’t expect
the Yankees to give him the chance to do it again. If they were going to give
him another shot at starting, they should be very straight forward about it
and do it in very controlled manner. Start him in the minors, let him stretch
out at his own pace, get into a routine, and then call him up once he’s
found a groove and has earned it. At times he does appear a little too
comfortable, something we never saw out of Phil Hughes because he did the
up-and-down thing for a few years. Maybe he needs a little kick in the ass in
that regard.

That’s all easier said than done, of course. After this season Joba will
have to clear (revocable) waivers to be sent to the minors because he’s been
in the bigs for more than three calendar years. If someone were to claim him,
the Yanks could pull him back, though he couldn’t go to the minors. If they
tried to send him down again, then those waivers are irrevocable and the
claiming team would get him. That might throw a wrench in any plan that
involves sending him to the minors.
