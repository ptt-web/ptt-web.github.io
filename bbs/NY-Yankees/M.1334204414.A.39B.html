Yankees back to .500 after Swisher&#39;s HR downs Baltimore
洋基靠著Swhisher的全壘打擊敗金鶯, 回到五成勝率

Nick Swisher hit a two-run homer in the 10th, and the New York Yankees beat
Baltimore 6-4 Wednesday night for their second straight extra-inning win and
a three-game sweep of the Orioles.
十局下正咩的兩分砲讓洋基6-4擊退金鶯, 系列賽三戰橫掃, 連兩場延長賽贏球

Curtis Granderson homered and drove in three runs for the Yankees, who won
consecutive extra-inning road games for the first time since July 16-17,
2001, at Philadelphia, according to STATS LLC.
Granderson擊出一支全壘打並跑回三分, 今天是洋基自2001在費城以來首次在客場
連續兩場以上延長賽贏球

After getting swept at Tampa Bay and starting 0-3 for the first time since
1998, the Yankees are back to .500 heading into their home opener against the
Los Angeles Angels on Friday.
開季先被光芒橫掃, 但馬上就橫掃金鶯, 勝率回到五成

With two outs in the 10th, Mark Teixeira hit an opposite-field pop off Kevin
Gregg (0-1) that landed just inside the left-field line and between third
baseman Mark Reynolds and left fielder Nolan Reimold.
十局下兩出局, 鐵爺擊出相反方向外野小飛球, 恰巧落在左外野跟三壘之間safe.

Swisher then worked the count full before hitting a no-doubt drive into the
center-field bleachers.
然後正咩在滿球數後夯出深遠的中外野兩分砲奠定勝局

Rafael Soriano (1-0) worked 1 1-3 innings of one-hit relief and 42-year-old
Mariano Rivera got three outs for his second save of the season and No. 605
of his career. One night earlier, Rivera sealed a 5-4, 12-inning win.
牛棚先是Soriano投了1又1/3局只被擊出一安打, 然後老將MO解決剩下的三人獲得本
季第二次跟生涯第605次save, 上一場MO才剛守成過5比4的領先

New York starter CC Sabathia gave up four runs and eight hits in six innings,
striking out eight and walking two. The left-hander won his previous seven
starts at Camden Yards, and although that streak ended, he retained his 16-2
record against Baltimore.
CC今天六局被擊出8安打失掉4分, 8三振2保送, 雖然今天沒拿到勝投中斷了他先前在
金鶯主場七連勝的紀錄, 但還是對金鶯16勝2敗

Sabathia took a beating on the mound in a fashion that had nothing to do with
his pitching line. He was smacked in his left hand trying to catch a bouncer
up in the middle in the second inning and had a line drive hit his left foot
in the fifth.

Robert Andino and Reynolds had two RBIs apiece for the Orioles, and starter
Jake Arrieta allowed four runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings.

Reynolds hit a two-run, two-out double in the fifth inning to give Baltimore
a 4-3 lead. Although he walked twice earlier, Reynolds was 0 for 6 with three
strikeouts against Sabathia.

New York pulled even in the seventh. After Orioles manager Buck Showalter
lifted Arrieta with a runner on first and two outs, Luis Ayala promptly
walked Derek Jeter on five pitches, and Granderson bounced an RBI single into
left field.

The Yankees put runners at second and third with two outs in the eighth
before Ayala struck out Russell Martin.

After throwing seven shutout innings against Minnesota on opening day,
Arrieta&#39;s perfect ERA vanished when Jeter led off with a double and
Granderson followed with his first home run, which also provided him with his
first two RBIs.

Arrieta retired the next 11 batters before Teixeira singled with two outs in
the fourth.

Sabathia struck out three of the first four batters before Matt Wieters
singled and Reynolds walked. Sabathia then tried to barehand a smash up the
middle by Ronny Paulino, and although the ball struck his hand, he wasn&#39;t
hurt. But the single loaded the bases, and Andino tied it by lining a two-out
single to center.

Baltimore loaded the bases with two outs in the third before Paulino hit into
a force play. By then, however, Sabathia&#39;s pitch count was already at 74.
New York took advantage of a wild streak by Arrieta to take a 3-2 lead in the
fifth. A walk, a hit batter and a single loaded the bases with no outs for
Jeter, who drove in a run with a chop off the plate.
