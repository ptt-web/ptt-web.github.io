Yankees pick up options on Cano, Granderson, Aardsma

The Yankees exercised their options on Curtis Granderson, Robinson Cano and
David Aardsma Monday, the first of many moves expected this offseason in The
Bronx.

Granderson and Cano both had $15 million options which were all but certain
to be picked up despite their postseason struggles. Aardsma made it back from
Tommy John surgery late in the year.

Now, GM Brian Cashman’s attention can shift to setting next season’s
roster, since the Yankees have plenty of question marks and plan to get under
the $189 million payroll threshold by 2014.

Rafael Soriano has three days to opt out of the final year of his contract
and become a free agent, joining fellow closer Mariano Rivera, who has yet to
decide on his status for next season.

The Yankees are confident CC Sabathia is going to be fine by Opening Day
after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left elbow last week, but the
rest of the starting rotation is up in the air. Andy Pettitte is among the
team’s free agents and sounded throughout the season like he wanted to come
back, especially after missing a chunk of the year with a fractured ankle.

Hiroki Kuroda proved he could pitch in the AL East, which was good news this
past season, but may make him harder to re-sign now that he’s a free agent
again.

Behind the plate, Russell Martin salvaged what looked to be a horrendous
season with a solid second half and while he may not receive another offer
like the three-year, $21 million deal he and the Yankees discussed last
spring training, he figures to draw plenty of interest with the lack of
quality catchers on the market.

If Nick Swisher signs elsewhere, which is likely given yet another October
flameout, he will need to be replaced in the outfield. Ichiro Suzuki could
return, but he played well enough after his trade from Seattle to generate
offers from other teams, as well.

Raul Ibanez is also a free agent and the Yankees have to decide whether to
bring him back as a lefty DH. He no doubt helped his cause by being one of
the few Bombers to perform well in the lineup in the playoffs. Andruw Jones
wasn’t as fortunate after his second half swoon cost him a spot on the
postseason roster. He said he intends to keep playing.

Eric Chavez was solid for much of the season, but showed he can’t play on a
regular basis thanks to his fragile health. And with Alex Rodriguez being
reduced to a part-time player in the playoffs, the Yankees need help at third
base.

Derek Lowe and Freddy Garcia can also test the waters and would like to be
back in starting rotations in 2013.
