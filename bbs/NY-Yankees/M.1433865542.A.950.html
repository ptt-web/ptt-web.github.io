James &#34; IPK 2.0 &#34; Kaprielian

<a href="http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/draftplayer?playerId=19585&amp;wjb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/draftplayer?playerId=19585&amp;wjb</a>

Sturdy and reliable, Kaprielian has carved up Pac-12 hitters at will since
arriving on campus, striking out more than a batter per inning in each of his
freshman, sophomore and junior years. He&#39;s solidly built at 6-foot-4 and
(200(-plus) pounds with a delivery similar to that of Kyle Kendrick and Mark
Appel; he kicks his leg up and brings it back down before striding home,
while his head and shoulders dip in unison with his lower half. The arm works
pretty well, with some mild head violence and crunch in the shoulder, though
things aren&#39;t overwhelmingly violent.

His stuff is solid. Kaprielian will sit 90-94 mph, working more toward the
low end of that spectrum from the stretch. He relies heavily on his slider
and curveball, with the former being the superior of the two; it has short
but sharp two-plane movement in the mid-80s. His curveball bends in between
78 and 81 mph and has more depth than the slider, but is merely average. He
does an excellent job of keeping both down in the zone (or below) and
limiting hard contact. Kaprielian&#39;s changeup is firm at 84-86 mph. He barely
uses it, but scouts are very intrigued by it and think it might develop into
an above-average or plus pitch.

Kaprielian&#39;s stuff is good but lacks the kind of explosion he would need to
rack up a ton of strikeouts in pro ball. He&#39;s going to have to locate and
projects to do so. As such, he does have a chance to go in the mid- to late
first round as a potential middle-of-the-rotation arm.

BA

Kaprielian shined for USA Baseball’s Collegiate National Team last summer,
pitching through a family tragedy as his mother died at age 58 from
breast cancer in June. His mother encouraged him to keep his commitment
before she passed away, and Kaprielian had a strong summer. Kaprielian
knows how to finish hitters off when he’s ahead in the count, with a plus
curveball as his best pitch.

He can land it, vary the shape of it and bury it as a chase pitch, and his
feel for the curve is his strongest attribute. He has dabbled with a slider as
well but has focused on the fastball, curveball and solid-average changeup
for most of the spring.

Kaprielian ranked No. 73 on the BA500 out of high school in 2012, spurning
the Mariners, who took a 40th-round flier. His fastball velocity was
among the reasons Kaprielian didn’t sign out of high school, as he topped
out at 92, and his fastball velocity remains a question this spring. While
he sat 93-95 in a relief role during UCLA’s 2013 national championship run,
Kaprielian generally pitches with a somewhat flat, straight 90-91 mph
four-seam fastball. He was coming on late, including a no-hitter and
velocity touching 95 mph. That could push the polished, 6-foot-4, 200-pounder
into the top half of the first round.

Kyle &#34; Glove Only &#34; Holder

<a href="http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/draftplayer?playerId=19689&amp;wjb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/draftplayer?playerId=19689&amp;wjb</a>

Another of the many interesting college middle infielders in this year&#39;s
draft, Holder burst on the scene mid-year when he was generating some
sandwich-round buzz because of strong glove work and an improved bat.

The defense is going to be the carrying tool for Holder, who gets some
plus-plus grades from scouts because of his explosive first step, terrific
hands and arm strength. He&#39;s the best defensive college shortstop in the
draft, a near lock to stay at the position despite his thick, mature build.

Where scouts question Holder is in the batter&#39;s box. He&#39;s strong, but lacks
bat speed, fluidity and has issues with his footwork. It&#39;s a high-effort
swing without much explosiveness. Holder is going to have to get by on
strength and hand-eye coordination to make any kind of offensive impact.
While his defensive profile has him more than halfway there, he might never
hit enough for it to matter.

BA BEST TOOLS：COLLEGE BEST ATHLETE、COLLEGE BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER

BA

A San Diego prep product, Holder intended to play baseball and basketball
at local Grossmont JC before realizing as a freshman that his future lay
in baseball. That spring was the first time he ever focused just on baseball,
and he began to emerge as a prospect. The athletic 6-foot-1, 185-pounder
doesn’t run better than average and has an uphill lefthanded swing path,
which one scout compared to a cricket swing.

However, Holder has shown a knack for the barrel this spring and makes
consistent contact. He’s unlikely to make an impact offensively but should
defensively, where scouts give him grades ranging from 55 to 70. He has an
average-to-plus arm to go with excellent, instinctive actions and footwork.

Holder has short-area quickness, making playing shortstop look easy and
smooth. He’s earned comparisons to glove-first American shortstops of recent
vintage from Walt Weiss and Gary DiSarcina to Brendan Ryan.

Jeff Degano

<a href="http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/draftplayer?playerId=19675&amp;wjb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://m.espn.go.com/mlb/draftplayer?playerId=19675&amp;wjb</a>

Degano is the second strong pitching prospect to come out of Indiana State in
recent years -- 2013 first-rounder Sean Manaea is the other -- and has been
dominant after missing most of 2013 and all of 2014 due to an elbow injury
and subsequent Tommy John surgery. Now an elderly red-shirt junior, Degano is
impressing scouts with his size and stuff.

Degano will sit in the low 90s with his fastball and touch 95 while keeping
the ball down in the zone. Once ahead in the count, he can break off a
sweeping mid- -70s slider that gets swings and misses away from lefties. It
regular grades out as average but projects above that. While Degano&#39;s
changeup is firm, he does have some feel for it, and scouts who are
optimistic about Degano give him a pass for not having a better one, saying
it would be further along right now if he hadn&#39;t been hurt in &#39;13 and &#39;14.
The pitch projects to be average for most, though some have a future 55 on it.

Degano&#39;s history of arm issues is troublesome. His delivery requires a lot
from his arm, and he doesn&#39;t utilize his lower half. But Degano does keep
things under control and projects to have above-average command. He&#39;s a solid
fourth-starter prospect with some injury red flags.
