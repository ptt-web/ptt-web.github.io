Russell Martin, Yankees in discussions to keep free-agent catcher in
pinstripes next season

Russell Martin wants to stay in the Bronx, but a future in pinstripes isn&#39;t
guaranteed.

The Yankees have had discussions with Russell Martin’s agent about a
possible return engagement in pinstripes and the free agent catcher, not
surprisingly, is interested.

“We’ve had some initial conversations and they’ve expressed interest in
bringing him back, but nothing substantial to date other than that,” said
Matt Colleran, Martin’s rep. “The organization, he loves it, working with
the staff, manager, coaches and players. It was all very positive. We’ll see
what happens as we move along here.”

Martin, who will be 30 in February, batted only .211 with a .311 on-base
percentage in 2012, but slugged a career-best 21 homers. He was hitting .199
as late as Sept. 3, but had seven homers, 17 RBI and a .277 average, .355
on-base percentage and a .578 slugging percentage afterward. Martin struggled
in the postseason, though, batting .161.

“He had a rough first half but he battled his way to get out of it,”
 Colleran said. “Based on his career, the player you saw the second half if
more indicative of the player he is.”

Colleran said other teams have called to express interest as well and noted
that the market would “take a little bit of time to develop.” Mike Napoli
and AJ Pierzynski are probably the biggest-name catchers on the market.

 Still, the Yankees seem like a good landing spot for Martin, though the team
will have to commit monies to re-signing Mariano Rivera and adding to its
starting rotation. Martin made $7.5 million last season and the two sides
discussed adding a two-year extension to that last spring.

 The Yankees, though, have said they are trying to position themselves to
lower their payroll below $189 million before 2014 to save on luxury tax
penalties.

 The Yanks have some catching prospects – Austin Romine and Gary Sanchez are
the headliners – but it’s unclear if Romine is ready to start and Sanchez
only turns 20 next month.

 Plus, Colleran says, Martin “is the kind of guy and player who embraces all
the things New York has to offer and the rivalries, too. He’s the type of
guy who feeds off that and that’s good, especially for a catcher, a guy
viewed as a leader. He doesn’t really shy away from anything.”
