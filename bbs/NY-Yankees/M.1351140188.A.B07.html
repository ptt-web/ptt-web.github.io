Joe Girardi Wishes on the A-Rod Fairy

Joe Girardi said on Wednesday that Alex Rodriguez would be the everyday third
baseman in 2013. But what if Rodriguez is no longer capable of playing every
day?

I note with some amusement that in today&#39;s Joe Girardi press conference he
said, &#34;I expect Alex [Rodriguez] to be our everyday third baseman. What&#39;s he
going to have to show me? That he&#39;s healthy and ready to go, that&#39;s the
bottom line, that he has no concerns and we have no concerns about putting
him out there every day.&#34; It&#39;s nice to see that we&#39;re kicking off the winter
with a healthy dose of fresh denial.

(編按:針對老吉對阿肉在2013的期待值 衍生出這一篇分析)

I spent a good deal of time last winter arguing that the Yankees needed to
have two third basemen this year. Rodriguez&#39;s propensity for injury and need
for increased rest through the designated hitter position meant that he had
started only of 534 of 810 possible games at third since 2007. This isn&#39;t a
problem if your reserve third basemen is someone productive, but if the
backup is Ramiro Pena, Cody Ransom, Angel Berroa, Kevin Russo, Alberto
Gonzalez, or even the 2011 version of Eric Chavez, the team is taking a big
hit whenever A-Rod goes down... and A-Rod was going to go down.

阿肉從2007年之後每年守備三壘的場次逐漸減少
然而這幾年頂替阿肉守三壘的人們在輸出產能上差了一個檔次
也包括了查帥哥

It was only due to Chavez&#39;s unlikely comeback year that the Yankees weren&#39;t
burned quite the same way in 2012. Not only does it take almost drunken
optimism to think that Rodriguez is going to be &#34;out there every day&#34; in
2013, one also has to be at least somewhat skeptical that Chavez can have
another such season at 35 given that he hadn&#39;t come close to this level of
production since 2004 and had spent, no foolin&#39;, an average of 121 days a
season on the disabled list from 2007 through 2011. Chavez is now headed to
free agency, and though the Yankees can certainly re-sign him, there is
considerable risk in relying upon him to once again keep the position above
replacement level when Rodriguez is restricted to his Kryptonian healing
chamber in the Fortress of Centaurhood.

雖然續簽帥哥的機會很高 但並沒辦法根治阿肉老化所產生的三壘輸出產能問題
因為帥哥本身其實也處於一個老化的狀態

If the Yankees truly intend to put all their eggs in the A-Rod basket, they
are setting themselves up to be in the exact fix they were in before Chavez&#39;s
revival -- and I&#39;m sorry, but even if you believe that Eduardo Nunez&#39;s bat
can carry the position (I don&#39;t), his defensive problems alone should
disqualify him. Conversely, Jayson Nix can field the position, but just isn&#39;t
enough of a hitter (career .199 average against right-handed pitching) to do
much more than platoon there, and even then his percentages against
left-handers (.239/.309/.428, worse than that as a Yankee) are poor compared
to the advantage the typical right-handed hitter has when facing a southpaw.

E哥是有棒子 但防守讓人不敢恭維
Nix是有防守 但棒子不夠大隻

I know the free-agent list for third basemen is appallingly bad this year,
likely consisting of Kevin Youkilis (maybe, if his option is bought out) and
guys like Brandon Inge, but that&#39;s no excuse for complacency. There are
trades to be made, perhaps, but they won&#39;t happen if acquiring depth at the
position isn&#39;t a priority for the organization. You know the cliché about
the definition of insanity being doing the same thing again and again and
expecting a different result. Well, thinking that Rodriguez is going to play
150 games next year is an example of exactly that.

光頭王和英吉被點名了 但可能性太低

結論:短期之內三壘的問題大概是無解了 只能期待阿肉歸位吧
