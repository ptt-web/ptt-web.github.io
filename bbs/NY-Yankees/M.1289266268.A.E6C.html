George Steinbrenner on Hall ballot

<span class="f4 b7 hl">George Steinbrenner George Michael Steinbrenner III was the owner and primary</span>

NEW YORK -- Yankees  owner George Steinbrenner will be on the Hall of Fame
veterans committee ballot next month with former New York manager Billy
Martin.

Steinbrenner owned the Yankees from 1973 until his death in July, and the
team won seven World Series championships, 11 AL pennants and 16 AL East
titles during his turbulent and blustery reign.

Martin had five stints as Yankees manager under Steinbrenner, who fired him
four times and let him resign once.

Former union head Marvin Miller also will be on the ballot with players Vida
Blue, Dave Concepcion, Steve Garvey, Ron Guidry, Tommy John, Al Oliver, Ted
Simmons and Rusty Staub.

Retired Toronto, Baltimore, Seattle and Philadelphia general manager Pat
Gillick also is on the 12-man ballot, the Hall said Monday.

To be elected, a candidate must appear on at least 75 percent of the 16
ballots. Results will be announced Dec. 6 at the winter meetings in Lake
Buena Vista, Fla.

This year&#39;s veterans committee ballot covers baseball&#39;s expansion era.
Players, managers, umpires, executives whose most significant impact was from
1973 on were considered in the first of a three-year cycle. Under changes
announced last summer, the golden era (1947-72) will be voted on in 2011 and
the pre-integration era (1871-1946) will be judged in 2012.

Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Whitey Herzog, Eddie Murray, Jim Palmer, Tony
Perez, Frank Robinson, Ryne Sandberg and Ozzie Smith are on the veterans
committee with Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Baltimore Orioles
President Andy MacPhail, former Phillies owner Bill Giles, Royals owner David
Glass, Bob Elliott of the Toronto Sun, Tim Kurkjian of ESPN, Tom Verducci of
Sports Illustrated and retired Los Angeles Times reporter Ross Newhan.

Miller, who helped players win multimillion-dollar salaries, fell two shorts
vote last year, when Herzog and umpire Doug Harvey were elected.

Anyone elected will be inducted into the Hall during ceremonies in
Cooperstown on July 24 with any players chosen in January by the Baseball
Writers&#39; Association of America. The BBWAA ballot includes holdovers Bert
Blyleven and Roberto Alomar, and newcomers Rafael Palmeiro and Juan Gonzalez.
