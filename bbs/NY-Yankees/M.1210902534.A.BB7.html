Q&amp;A with Joba Chamberlain
Yankees&#39; phenom hurler sits down with MLB.com
By Bryan Hoch / MLB.com

It&#39;s sometimes difficult to believe that Joba Chamberlain still has less than
one year of big league service time, but in under 12 months, the
hard-throwing right-hander has already become something of a larger-than-life
figure running out of the Yankees bullpen. In this edition of the Yankees
Insider, Chamberlain joined MLB.com for a wide-ranging Q&amp;A that touches on a
variety of his interests, tastes and memories.
MLB.com: What do you remember about the circumstances of being called to the
big leagues for the first time?

Chamberlain: It was kind of hectic, because I was getting out that night [on
Aug. 6, 2007] and I made sure that I called everybody and told them I got
called up. Then I was just trying to figure out how I would get to the hotel
[in Toronto] and figure out what was going to go on from there. I tried to
get some sleep and I got to the ballpark, and of course I had to carry my
baseball bag in, and all of a sudden three cameras came. Phil Hughes sold me
out, so there I am, by myself with my bag. I&#39;m between [Ron] Villone and
Farnsy [Kyle Farnsworth] in the clubhouse, and it all happened so fast. I had
to make sure I was where I needed to be.

MLB.com: What is it about playing in New York that stands out in your mind?

Chamberlain: I think it&#39;s the tradition and everything that goes along with
being a New York Yankee. You hear about it, and being a baseball fan, you
understand. But when you finally put the uniform on, you realize it goes
further than this uniform. It definitely makes you feel privileged to wear
it.

MLB.com: What is your daily routine, and how has it changed since you became
a reliever?

Chamberlain: I&#39;ll get up and eat breakfast, relax and run an errand, and then
work out and come to the field. At home, I usually get to the park at about
2:30, and depending on if I have anything to do before the game, sometimes
I&#39;ll leave before the bus on the road just so I can come in and relax and
just hang out. Adjusting from a starter to a reliever was the hardest part,
because there were a couple of times where as a starter, you could beat
yourself up [in the gym] for three or four days. I remember a couple of times
where I probably did too much in the weight room. You need to make sure where
you are and maybe get a little stronger, but you can&#39;t be in that starter
routine where you lift hard. That was the biggest thing. I knew if I pitched
that day, I&#39;d have the next day off.

MLB.com: What do you think has been the biggest influence on your career?

Chamberlain: I think it&#39;s just never relaxing. Last year I didn&#39;t have that
opportunity because I got called up [to each level] a month apart. It was
never being satisfied, and trying to get better, and asking questions. It&#39;s
one thing to get here, but it&#39;s another thing to stay here. I try to come in
and get better every day and try to learn something.

MLB.com: Any one person stand out in your development?

Chamberlain: I try to take a little bit from everybody. I think I learned a
lot from the hitters, too, talking to Derek [Jeter], Jason [Giambi] and Alex
[Rodriguez]. I used to hit, but not at this level. You&#39;re talking to three
guys that have done it, and I have it from a pitcher&#39;s aspect of how you stay
in your game and do what you do. I think you have to go to the other side and
ask those guys what they recognize and what they look for. I don&#39;t want to be
in that comfort zone of just looking at it from a pitcher&#39;s side.

MLB.com: Who is your best friend in baseball, and why?

Chamberlain: Probably Jason. It&#39;s hard to say. I could say Jason or I could
say Chien-Ming [Wang], and then people would say, &#34;How are you and Chien-Ming
best friends?&#34; I guess it&#39;s our personalities. You&#39;d think that we would
clash -- extroverts sometimes don&#39;t go together, you know what I&#39;m saying?
But we go together good. Jason is one of the most down-to-earth and genuine
people you can meet. It&#39;s one thing to be a great baseball player, but he&#39;s a
great human being.

MLB.com: What has been your best moment on the field so far?

Chamberlain: Getting to celebrate [the 2007 Wild Card] with these guys. With
the long year that they had, I got to be part of the opportunity to go to the
playoffs and be a part of this team. Hopefully, there&#39;s many more to come.

MLB.com: What&#39;s your best moment off the field?

Chamberlain: Probably the people that I&#39;ve met. I&#39;ve met so many people that
I&#39;ve looked up to for a long time. I met Charles Barkley and that was huge.
Paul [Teutel] Sr. from Orange County Choppers, that whole family was awesome.
Russell Simmons was great. These are people you see and look at them in such
a different light, and then you meet them and they&#39;re some of the most
down-to-earth, nice people. I admire people who are real and speak their
minds, and don&#39;t change for anything.

MLB.com: What are some of your hobbies and interests away from the stadium?

Chamberlain: Other than hanging out with [my 2-year-old son] Karter, I like
to spend time with my family. I like to travel too. Last year I went to
Puerto Rico, Arizona, and Las Vegas. I&#39;d never been to any of them. There&#39;s
opportunities to talk to kids and sign autographs and enjoy what you did on
the field. Hopefully, this year will be my first year traveling overseas. I
might get to see Chien-Ming in Taiwan, and my buddy Rick VandenHurk on the
Marlins is from Holland. Hopefully, I&#39;ll get an opportunity to go spread my
wings for a little bit.
