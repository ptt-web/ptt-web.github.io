Cano, Granderson win Silver Slugger Awards
By Bryan Hoch / MLB.com | 11/02/11 6:30 PM ET


NEW YORK -- Robinson Cano and Curtis Granderson will pick up some hardware
when they return from their trip to Taiwan, having been announced on
Wednesday as winners of American League Silver Slugger Awards at their
respective positions.

The pair of All-Stars enjoyed standout seasons in powering the Yankees&#39;
lineup, creating headaches for opposing managers as they ranked first and
second, respectively, for the AL&#39;s RBI title. Granderson took the crown by
just one RBI.

For Cano, this is his third Silver Slugger Award, having also earned the
honors in 2006 and &#39;10.

Developing into one of the game&#39;s top all-around threats, the 29-year-old
Cano batted .302 with 104 runs scored, 46 doubles, 28 homers and 118 RBIs in
159 games.

Cano did not go more than two days during the regular season without a hit,
and his 114 RBIs as a second baseman surpassed Tony Lazzeri&#39;s 113 in 1926 to
set the Yankees&#39; all-time record at the position.

Cano also ranked second in the Majors with 81 extra-base hits and had a Major
League-leading 91 RBIs with runners in scoring position.

His power force was on full display as he won the 2011 State Farm Home Run
Derby during the All-Star Game festivities at Arizona&#39;s Chase Field,
outslugging the Red Sox&#39;s Adrian Gonzalez in the final round.

Granderson&#39;s turnaround in pinstripes actually started in August 2010, when
hitting coach Kevin Long revamped his swing in a Texas batting cage, but
Granderson reaped the full rewards in &#39;11.

Conquering his earlier issues with hitting left-handed pitching, the
30-year-old Granderson was a punishing force for southpaws and right-handers
alike, earning his first Silver Slugger nod.

Granderson hit .262 with 136 runs scored, 26 doubles, 41 homers, 119 RBIs and
85 walks in 156 games, setting career highs in runs, home runs and RBIs. He
led the Majors in runs scored, ranked second in home runs and tied for second
in extra-base hits (81).

A big league leading 16 of Granderson&#39;s homers came off lefties, and he was
also a threat on the basepaths. Granderson stole 25 bags to become the only
player in Major League history to record at least 40 homers, 10 triples and
25 steals in a single season.

Granderson placed himself among select company in Yankees history with his
season, becoming just the third Bombers center fielder with at least 41
homers in a single season. Only Mickey Mantle (three times) and Joe DiMaggio
(once) had accomplished the feat previously.

Cano and Granderson are currently headlining a squad of big leaguers playing
a five-game exhibition tour of Taiwan against the Chinese Taipei national
team.



Cano的第三座、Granderson的第一座SS

恭喜他們!
