&#34;Look at me, I&#39;m on a boat!&#34;

Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s safe to say that we’ve seen a tremendous 1st
half of baseball in 2010. Can anybody else believe that it’s already the
All-Star Break in Anaheim? The season seems to be flying by, but it certainly
hasn’t disappointed yet. Without further ado, let’s take some time to
reflect on the 1st half of baseball and reminisce the top games and plays.
Starts after the jump!



The Yankees, going into the All-Star Break, have the best record in Major
League Baseball at 56-32. They remain 2 games up on the Tampa Bay Rays and 5
games up on the Boston Red Sox. This time last year, sitting at 51-37, the
Yankees trailed the Red Sox by 3 games in the AL East. Clearly, the Yanks
have had a better 1st half of the season this year. In fact, the last time
the Yankees posted such a great record before the All-Star Break was back in
2004 when their record was 55-31 at the break. (Last time Yanks had a record
of at least 25 games above .500 was in 1998).

Let’s put together statistics compiled over the last15 years to compare past
teams to our 2010 version.

Please note: The 1st and 2nd halves of seasons are not necessarily 81 games
each. The 1st half has fluctuated between 81 games (in 1998) and 93 games (in
2003). For the sake of keeping the statistics consistent, I will use the
first 81 games of each season.

Year Wins Losses  Win %   Runs     Runs       Run Diff.
                          For      Against
1996 49   32      60.5%   423      385        +38

1997 46   35      56.7%   436      358        +78

1998 61   20      75.3%   484      327        +157

1999 50   31      61.7%   431      371        +60

2000 44   37      54.3%   437      396        +39

2001 48   33      58.6%   421      348        +73

2002 50   31      61.7%   452      344        +108

2003 51   30      63.0%   457      353        +104

2004 51   30      63.0%   447      400        +47

2005 42   39      51.9%   438      410        +28

2006 46   35      56.8%   447      392        +55

2007 40   41      48.2%   428      370        +58

2008 44   37      54.3%   384      361        +23

2009 48   33      59.3%   427      351        +78

2010 50   31      61.7%   436      340        +96

AVERAGE
     48   33      58.6%   437      367        +70


While the runs scored statistic is relatively average, the pitching has been
exceptional. Only one team (1998) had better pitching through the first 81
games of the season and they’re regarded as one of the greatest teams to
ever play the game.

<span class="f6 hl">Eight Yankee players have made the All-Star roster this year, the most since</span>
<span class="f6 hl">2004.</span> The double-play tandem of Derek Jeter and Robinson Cano will be
starting in Anaheim. Alex Rodriguez was selected as backup 3rd baseman (by
Joe Girardi) and Nick Swisher was voted in by the fans via 2010 Final Vote
(beating out Kevin Youkilis in the closest voting result ever). The pitchers
include CC Sabathia, Andy Pettitte, Phil Hughes and Mariano Rivera (Rivera
and Sabathia will not participate, though).

Yankee First Half Awards:

<span class="f6 hl">Most Valuable Player: Robinson Cano.</span> He has truly blossomed into an amazing
baseball player. He currently has 16 homers, 57 RBI, .337 BA and .390 OBP
(on-pace for career highs in all categories). With only 1 error committed in
the field, he is definitely earning his $9 million paycheck.

<span class="f6 hl">Cy Young: Andy Pettitte.</span> The man has &#34;turned back the clock&#34; (I will award
credit to Jedi Master A-Rod for that) and has been much more than fans had
expected. Although Sabathia’s numbers have been just as good, and in some
cases better, Pettitte has been the most consistent starter. His 2.70 ERA and
record of 11-2 are outstanding. The Yankees record when Pettitte starts is
14-3 (in two of those losses, Pettitte went 7 innings allowing only 2 earned
runs). He’s 38, but pitching like it’s 1997 again. Hopefully, this surge
will last into the 2nd half and postseason where it always does.

<span class="f6 hl">Most Surprising Player: Brett Gardner.</span> No surprises here. Last season, we all
learned just how valuable Brett could be with his speed. The only problem, he
slapped at the ball when at the plate and had a mediocre batting average and
on-base percentage. This year, he’s been deadly. He’s 7th in the league in
WAR (3.4) and 4th in the league in stolen bases (25). His .309 batting
average and .392 on-base percentage are excellent for a mainly bottom of the
order hitter. He can beat out plenty of infield balls for hits and has become
a remarkable fielder in left and center.

<span class="f6 hl">The Carl Pavano Award: Nick Johnson.</span> Here’s a new award that recognizes
Yankee players that are being paid to be injured. Of course, we all knew Nick
Johnson from his early days with the Yankees from 2001-2003. However, Cashman
brought him back this year and he has been nowhere in sight. He suffered a
wrist injury back in May and has been out ever since. He played in 24 games,
tallying up an unprecedented .167 average with 2 homers and 8 RBI. His OBP
was great at .388, but he’s gone for a long while more. See you in
September! ... or will we?

<span class="f6 hl">The &#34;We Can’t Replicate You&#34; Award: Mariano Rivera.</span> Words can’t describe
how truly incredible this man is. He’s 40 years old and having, arguably,
his best season ever. He is 20 for 22 in save opportunities, blowing one on
July 4th against Toronto and one back on May 16th against the Minnesota Twins
(let’s not talk about that game). He had a Houdini-like escape from a
bases-loaded jam in Arizona with 0 out to secure the victory and has been
great all season long. His ERA is 1.05 with a 0.64 WHIP (think about how
ridiculous that is).

<span class="f6 hl">Pinstripe Alley Clutch Player of the 1st Half: Alex Rodriguez.</span> What a turn
around A-Rod has had in his career, eh? After an MVP-like postseason last
year in which he hit 4 homeruns that gave the Yankees momentum, he has hit
plenty more this year. A dramatic 2-run homer off Papelbon to tie the game
9-9 in the 9th inning back on May 17th, three grand slams (May 14, May 31,
July 6) that gave the Yankees triumphant leads, A 2-run 8th inning dinger to
give the Bombers a 4-2 lead against Seattle, and his 2-run single against
Seattle on July 8 to give the Yanks a 3-1 lead. Time after time, he has come
up with huge hits late in games.

<span class="f6 hl">Top 5 Games of the 1st Half:</span>

<span class="f6 hl">5) Wednesday, April 7 – Yankees 3 Red Sox 1:</span> In what turned out to be a
classic pitching duel between Andy Pettitte and John Lackey, the newest
Yankee made the biggest difference. Jonathan Papelbon came out for his second
inning in the 10th to face Curtis Granderson, and the &#34;Grandy-man&#34; hit a bomb
to right off the atrocious closer. It was Granderson’s 2nd homer in 3 days
up in Bahston. Needless to say, Rivera shut the door.

<span class="f6 hl">4) Sunday, July 4 – Yankees 7 Blue Jays 6:</span> The fireworks certainly weren’t
forgotten on this special 80th birthday of George Steinbrenner. The Yankees
had earned a 3-0 lead before Hughes gave it up to Dewayne Wise by
surrendering a 3-run homer to give Toronto a lead. Adam Lind went yard to
make it 5-3, and then Brett Gardner benefited from a misplayed ball by Wise
for his 2nd homer in two days and his 2nd inside-the-park-homerun of his
career, making the game 5-5. Teixeira’s RBI double in the 7th should have
put away Toronto because Rivera hadn’t blown a save in July since 2004.
Dewayne Wise singled to tie the game. Bottom 10, Marcus Thames steps up to
the plate for the 1st time since getting off the DL and lines an RBI single
to leftcenter. He wanted pie. AGAIN.

<span class="f6 hl">3) Wednesday, June 23 – Yankees 6 Diamondbacks 5:</span> This game started off
terribly as Dontrelle Willis couldn’t threw a strike if his life depended on
it. The Yankees helped him out with 4 base-running gaffs in the first 2
innings. The game was back and forth… Arod’s sac-fly in the 9th tied the
game and Curtis Granderson hit a go-ahead solo shot in the 10th. The real
story was the courageous effort of Mariano Rivera. He loaded the bases with 0
outs, got Chris Young to pop out, Adam Laroche to pop out, and he struck out
Mark Reynolds to end the game. HOUDINI.

<span class="f6 hl">2) Monday, May 17 – Yankees 11 Red Sox 9:</span> Yankees jumped out to a 5-0 lead
in the 1st inning off of Matsuzaka. A huge comeback by Boston and back and
forth scoring saw multiple lead changes. Eventually Boston went up 9-7 going
into the 9th. Gardner doubled to lead off the inning and Alex Rodriguez
crushed the first pitch he saw from Jonathan Papelbon to tie the game. Cano
made out, Francisco Cervelli was plunked by a pitch and Marcus Thames smashed
a 2-run walkoff homerun. It was the first time Papelbon had ever surrendered
2 homers in one game.

<span class="f6 hl">1)    Sunday, June 28 – Yankees 8 Dodgers 6:</span> A game most Yankee fans turned
off after Joba let up a run in the 8th… it’s a shame they had to miss it.
The Yankees overcame a 6-2 deficit in the top of the 9th inning to tie thanks
to Chad Huffman and Colin Curtis. Robinson Cano hits a game-winning 2-run
homer in the top of the 10th and Rivera finishes off Torre and the Dodgers.

<span class="f6 hl">Breakdown of records against other teams:</span>

Tampa Bay – 2-3

Boston – 5-3

Baltimore – 10-2

Toronto – 3-3

<span class="f6 hl">Total Against AL East: 20-11</span>

Detroit – 1-3

Chicago – 2-1

Minnesota – 4-2

Cleveland – 3-1

Kansas City – 0-0

<span class="f6 hl">Total Against AL Central: 10-7</span>

Texas – 3-0

LA Angels – 3-3

Oakland – 5-1

Seattle – 4-3

<span class="f6 hl">Total Against AL West: 15-7</span>

Arizona – 2-1

Houston – 3-0

LA Dodgers – 2-1

NY Mets – 3-3

Philadelphia – 1-2

<span class="f6 hl">Total Inter-league Record: 11-7</span>

Miscellaneous Notes:

1)    Yankee Home Record: 28-13

2)    Yankee Away Record: 28-19

3)    Yankee starting pitchers have combined for 48 wins out of the total 56

4)    The Yankees have three pitchers with at least 11 wins (Sabathia,
Hughes, Pettitte)

5)    Alex Rodriguez heads into the All-Star Break with 597 career homeruns.

Bob Sheppard 1910-2010: Before ending this article, I would like to throw in
my share of comments on the sudden passing of Bob Sheppard. He was 99 years
old and definitely lived a life at the PA system in Yankee Stadium that
others dream of living. It can’t be explained how truly missed he will be. It
’s a shame that some Yankee fans will grow up having never attended a game
in which he was the voice of the realm. He had, what Reggie Jackson called,
the &#34;Voice of God&#34; and was perhaps the most recognizable announcer in the
history of sports. He’s been gone from Yankee Stadium for 3 years, but he
will never be gone from our hearts. Bob Sheppard, rest in peace.
