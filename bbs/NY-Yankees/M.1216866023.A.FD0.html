* * * * * * * * * * JORGE POSADA UPDATE, 11:26 a.m. * * * * * * * * *

Jorge Posada stepped up with the information. The MRI showed that his
labrum is worse and that he has capsule damage. He will need surgery
and a six-month rehab. However … he will try rehabbing for the next
two weeks and consider trying to return as a DH and first baseman.

Posada said the Yankees are willing to have him play again this season
even if it means missing part of next season. But if he comes back this
season, he won’t catch.

“Catching is out of the question,” he said.

It seems curious to me that they would not want Posada ready to start
next season, especially given how ineffective he was as a hitter.
Obviously the injury has hampered his ability at the plate. But we’ll
see what happens in a few weeks.

UPDATE, 1:07 p.m.:

The decision to delay surgery for Jorge Posada is being driven, at
least partly, by team president Randy Levine according to several
people close to the situation. He thinks the Yankees need to get
some return on the money they spent on Posada.

Why Levine would get involved in baseball and medical decisions isn’t
certain, but he has that right as team president. That could explain why
the Yankees were being so reticent to give information out.

Posada also revealed that he called Joe Torre to ask for advice.
Obviously he wants the opinion of somebody outside the organization.
Posada is not the kind of guy who would mindlessly do what the team asks.
He’ll try and do what is right.

For now, Posada will try and rehab without throwing and come back
as a hitter. But understand this: Once he has surgery, he will need
six months to rehab. So every day that they delay surgery is another
day that takes away from Posada being ready for spring training and
the 2009 season.

UPDATE, 2:05 p.m.:

Just spoke to Brian Cashman, who said the decision on Posada involves
everybody from the trainers on up to ownership. He feels that Posada
would fill a need the team has now “better than anything I can get
in a trade” so he wants to see whether rehab is possible.

“We’ll have a tough decision to make in 13 days,” he said. “We’ll
just have to see where he is.”
