NEW YORK -- The Yankees&#39; fantasy of fitting Miguel Cabrera for pinstripes is
a tantalizing one, but the reality of parting with top pitching talent as
bait could hinder the process.
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman set out to gauge the market to replace
third baseman Alex Rodriguez during this week&#39;s General Managers Meetings in
Orlando, Fla., and perhaps the largest development is that the Marlins appear
primed to deal the talented 24-year-old Cabrera.

Florida will have numerous choices and destinations if it indeed moves
Cabrera -- a lifetime .313 hitter who has already won a World Series and been
selected to four National League All-Star teams.

Cabrera would represent perhaps the most ready-made replacement for
Rodriguez, the probable 2007 American League MVP who effectively ended his
association with the Yankees when he opted out of his contract during Game 4
of the World Series.

The New York Daily News reported that Cashman met with the Marlins at about 6
p.m. ET on Tuesday. But the price for Cabrera, who will be eligible for free
agency after the 2009 season, could be too high for the Yankees to stomach.

Citing a source with knowledge of the situation, the newspaper reported that
the Yankees would have to include either Phil Hughes, Joba Chamberlain or Ian
Kennedy in any trade for Cabrera.

That could be a deal breaker for the Yankees, who have developed their
pitching program and are reluctant to part with the hurlers, all of whom
contributed on the Major League level this season. Cashman told reporters he
would be &#34;hard pressed&#34; to deal young talent.

&#34;I think our farm system has taken the right steps forward. There&#39;s power in
numbers,&#34; Cashman told the AP. &#34;We&#39;ll soak up all the information down here
and then we&#39;ll take it back to New York and kind of assess what the real
potential market is for us.&#34;

The Yankees&#39; offer to Florida could revolve around a secondary tier of
prospects, but that may not be enough to interest the Marlins. Cabrera is
expected to earn more than $10 million in salary arbitration, which is
thought to be too formidable for the modest Marlins budget.

Yankees executive vice president Hank Steinbrenner told the AP on Tuesday
that the team was not aware of Florida&#39;s asking price.

&#34;We don&#39;t know yet. We&#39;ll probably know by [Tuesday evening],&#34; Steinbrenner
said. &#34;My sense is that it might be too much, but we&#39;ll see. It&#39;s early.&#34;

Cabrera is coming off a season in which he batted .320, while collecting
career highs in home runs (34) and RBIs (119). Issues have developed about
his conditioning, as maintaining his weight has become a concern. With his
size, he is in danger of outgrowing the third-base position, where he
committed 23 errors and had a .941 fielding percentage.

Cabrera, who earned $7.45 million this year, is already the third-fastest
player in Major League history to reach the 500-RBI plateau. A .313 lifetime
hitter, he had his best season in 2006 under new Yankees manager Joe Girardi,
batting .339 to finish second in the league and win his second consecutive
Silver Slugger Award.

If the season were to begin today, the Yankees&#39; third baseman would likely be
Wilson Betemit, who was acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever
Scott Proctor before the trade deadline in July. Betemit was coveted by the
Yankees for more than a year, but he batted just .226 in 84 at-bats for New
York in limited duty.
