NEW YORK -- Alex Rodriguez&#39;s last attempt to reach a major home run milestone
was painful to watch. Remember? He had gotten to 499, in the summer of 2007,
faster than anyone at the start of the season could have conceived was
possible, even for him. He was about to turn 32 years old, and he was at the
peak of his powers. He had hit 14 home runs during a torrid April, then five
in May, then nine in June, and then -- after he&#39;d crushed 499, an
eighth-inning two-run shot off the Royals&#39; Gil Meche on July 25 in Kansas
City -- seven in July. Thirty-five home runs, and August wouldn&#39;t begin for
another week. Surely, everyone thought, he&#39;d become the 500 home run club&#39;s
youngest member well before the calendar&#39;s page flipped.

Then? He couldn&#39;t do it. In fact, for a while, he couldn&#39;t muster a hit of
any type. Over the next 10 days, he was all but shut down by a veritable
No-Star team of Royals and Orioles and White Sox, many of them pitchers who
are just three years later no longer in the big leagues -- pitchers like
Brian Burres and Daniel Cabrera and Ryan Bukvich and Ryan Braun (not that
one) and John Parrish and Odalis Perez and Jamie Walker. After that shot off
Meche, Rodriguez went hitless in his next 21 at-bats, and homerless in 28,
over 37 plate appearance. He just couldn&#39;t do what he had always done. This
was like seeing Lady Gaga dressed in sweatpants, or that guy from Twilight
unable to pop out an abdominal muscle. You almost felt sorry for him.

When he finally got there, with a first inning, three-run bomb off Kansas
City&#39;s Kyle Davies in Yankee Stadium on August 4, it seemed more a relief
than an achievement. After that, he was A-Rod again, and sailed along to what
was by most measures the greatest offensive season of his great career, and
one of the greatest anyone has ever produced: a .314 average, 54 homers, 156
RBIs, 24 stolen bases, his third MVP award. But the memory of his mid-summer
struggle to reach 500 stayed with us -- especially given what happened in the
years to follow. Now, as he again chases a historic home run -- his next will
be No. 600 -- it is clear that memory stayed with him.

<span class="hl">&#34;For me, the whole thing as I approach 600, the whole thing that I think</span>
<span class="hl">about is the perspective of where I was when I hit 500 and how things are</span>
<span class="hl">different now,&#34; Rodriguez said last week during what has become a rarity for</span>
<span class="hl">him over the past two seasons: a question and answer session with the</span>
<span class="hl">assembled media in which he expressed slightly more than quotidian</span>
<span class="hl">platitudes. &#34;For me, early on, all I thought it was about was accumulating</span>
<span class="hl">numbers. Try to hit 40 or 50 and drive in 140 or 130 and hopefully make the</span>
<span class="hl">playoffs and maybe advance, but after winning a world championship and</span>
<span class="hl">attaining that goal you realize that it is not about [numbers]. It is about</span>
<span class="hl">obviously winning the world championship.&#34;</span>

Rodriguez has never been adept at expressing himself in public, even when he
genuinely tries. He has often seemed overwhelmed by the idea that people are
watching everything that he does and that he is performing for them. The
result is that most of what he does seems somehow robotic and artificial, as
if he&#39;s overly conscious of what he is doing at that moment, or supposed to
be doing, instead of simply being in the moment and doing it. When he makes
an out, and jogs off the field, you can almost see him thinking, &#34;Now I am
supposed to casually trot off the field, slowly but not too slowly, perhaps
shaking my head a bit.&#34; After he hits an important home run: &#34;Now I am
supposed to clap my hands and raise my arms in the air, and maybe high-five
the third base-coach as I pass by him.&#34; When he gives a press conference: &#34;Be
humble but confident, credit your teammates, smile a lot and talk about how
you want the team to win.&#34;

The situations in which Rodriguez appears to be completely natural,
completely of and in the moment, are generally when he is in action on the
field -- when he torques his body to produce that beautiful swing of his,
when he makes a dazzlingly athletic defensive play. There is no time for
forethought or artificiality then; nature takes over, and he looks, for once,
comfortable. When he was chasing 500, however, during those frustrating 10
days, the other part of his personality seemed to bleed into that which had
previously been inviolable. Instead of just hitting, as only he can, it was
as if he were saying to himself, even as the pitch came in, &#34;It is time for
me, Alex Rodriguez, to join the 500 home-run club ... now.&#34; Of course, it
wouldn&#39;t work. Baseball -- and, for most people, life -- doesn&#39;t work like
that, even when you&#39;re Alex Rodriguez and they&#39;re Ryan Braun, not that one.

Why did Rodriguez develop as such? Part of it, we can imagine, is that since
he was a teenager he had been A-Rod, among the most talented baseball players
in the world. So talented that he was rarely questioned or criticized about
anything by anyone who mattered to him. So talented that everything came so
easy to him that he never had to think about changing. Angels center fielder
Torii Hunter was born nine days before Rodriguez in 1975, was selected by the
Twins 20th overall in the 1993 draft in which the Mariners picked Rodriguez
first and has battled him in the American League for parts of 14 seasons now.
He remembered the other day his first ever encounter with Rodriguez.

<span class="hl">&#34;It was 1992, and we were in Boise, Idaho, playing together on the Junior</span>
<span class="hl">Olympic team, the South team,&#34; Hunter recalled. &#34;This tall kid, a quarterback</span>
<span class="hl">from Westminster High School in Miami walked in, 6&#39;3&#34;, hands big as hell, a</span>
<span class="hl">shortstop. Someone hit a groundball up the middle, he fielded the ball</span>
<span class="hl">between his legs, turned around and threw the guy out at first. I&#39;m like,</span>
<span class="hl">damn, this guy is a straight athlete! Then he comes up to the plated with a</span>
<span class="hl">wooden bat -- he was the only one using a wooden bat -- this taped up wooden</span>
<span class="hl">bat, and boom, hits one 430 feet. We were both 16 years old, among the</span>
<span class="hl">youngest there.</span>

&#34;I hadn&#39;t seen many baseball players,&#34; Hunter continued, &#34;but these were like
the top 100 baseball players in the country, and nobody stood out more than
this guy. I go back home, and I tell everybody in my hometown in Arkansas. I
said, dude, there&#39;s this guy named Alex Rodriguez. He&#39;s going to be the best
player ever. They&#39;re like, better than Shawon Dunston? Because everybody
believed in Shawon Dunston in my &#39;hood in Arkansas -- I don&#39;t know why,
because he was playing in San Francisco, but they loved Shawon Dunston. I&#39;m
like, yes, better than Shawon Dunston. Ten times better than Shawon Dunston.&#34;

For the next decade or so, Rodriguez continued being 10 times better than
Shawon Dunston. That he was 10 times better than Shawon Dunston may have led
him to believe that anything he said or did (including, it turned out, taking
PEDs) was the right thing and that those who criticized him were simply
wrong, or jealous, because he was 10 times better than Shawon Dunston.

<span class="hl">Then came his agonizing quest for his 500th home run, a crack in the façade.</span>
<span class="hl">Then, in early 2009, the façade crumbled altogether. It was a perfect,</span>
<span class="hl">image-shattering storm, beginning with the February revelation by SI&#39;s Selena</span>
<span class="hl">Roberts and David Epstein that Rodriguez had used PEDs, and a month later the</span>
<span class="hl">release of an embarrassing Details magazine photo shoot in which Rodriguez</span>
<span class="hl">kissed himself in a mirror, wearing a muscles-revealing sleeveless shirt.</span>
<span class="hl">Rodriguez at first tried to deal with the situation the only way he knew how,</span>
<span class="hl">by putting on another show of artificiality at the press conference in the</span>
<span class="hl">tent behind the third base stands at the Yankees&#39; spring training home in</span>
<span class="hl">Tampa. This time, however, no one was buying it just because he was so much</span>
<span class="hl">better than Shawon Dunston. No one believed that he might actually cry during</span>
<span class="hl">the 32-second silence in which he tried to squeeze out a tear. The emperor</span>
<span class="hl">had no clothes; everybody knew it, and, crucially, he finally knew it. &#34;I</span>
<span class="hl">miss simply being a baseball player,&#34; he said plaintively that day, and after</span>
<span class="hl">that day&#39;s disaster, he seemed committed to becoming that, and pretty much</span>
<span class="hl">only that.</span>

Later that spring, Rodriguez had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his hip
and went away to Colorado to rehab. When he came back, returning for an early
May road series against the Orioles, he was different, and still is
different. &#34;I think after coming back from Colorado and talking to most of
the guys in Baltimore last year it&#39;s a lot easier, it&#39;s a lot more enjoyable
when you think about doing the little things to help the team win,&#34; he said
last week. That Rodriguez is still not a fluid communicator is underscored by
tortured quotes such as that one, but these days he seems to finally
understand this about himself: that people will no longer agree with or
believe or validate whatever he says simply because he is so very good at
baseball, and that it&#39;s not worth trying anymore. So he doesn&#39;t, not often.

A-Rod at 600 is a different person than was A-Rod at 500 because he now
understands that the only thing that is fully under his control is what he
does on the field. He understands that no one will buy the rest of his act
anymore, so he is careful to keep it out of the public&#39;s view. That
development seems to have unburdened him, suggest opponents and teammates.
&#34;For me, it seems like he&#39;s having a lot more fun -- a lot more fun,&#34; says
Hunter. &#34;He was always preparing himself early on in his career, he was
always focused. He didn&#39;t say much at all on the field or anything like that.
Now, he&#39;s cracking jokes, he&#39;s laughing more. Don&#39;t get me wrong -- he still
prepares himself. We&#39;re in batting practice, and we see A-Rod in the outfield
running, doing different drills, and I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s watching film
inside the clubhouse. But he&#39;s having more fun too.&#34;

His unburdening has also helped him to help his team win in ways other than
his offensive production. &#34;I can only speak for the last two years, but he&#39;s
been a great teammate,&#34; says CC Sabathia, who spent one of his first days as
a Yankee two years ago standing off to the side in one of his trademark
many-XL t-shirts, watching his new teammate conduct his PED-use-admitting
press conference, and probably wondering what he&#39;d gotten himself into. &#34;I
know he cares a lot about the younger guys, teaching them and talking to
them. Him and [Robinson] Cano are really close -- he&#39;s always talking to him.
He tells guys what they need to be told, but he doesn&#39;t put himself out there
and draw attention to it.&#34;

<span class="hl">Last October, when I asked catcher Francisco Cervelli which of his teammates</span>
<span class="hl">had most helped him transition from a .233-hitting minor leaguer to a rookie</span>
<span class="hl">big leaguer who batted .298 and seamlessly filled in for an injured Jorge</span>
<span class="hl">Posada, his answer was as quick as it was surprising. &#34;A-Rod,&#34; he said. &#34;He</span>
<span class="hl">helps me with everything -- everything. I learn so many things from him,</span>
<span class="hl">calling the game, offensively, defensively, game situations, everything. He&#39;s</span>
<span class="hl">the man. Maybe he saw at the beginning that I want to work, I want to play,</span>
<span class="hl">and he wanted to help me. I feel lucky to have him.&#34;</span>

There is no doubt, however, about the identity of the person whom the new
A-Rod has helped most of all: Rodriguez himself. He is no longer far and away
the game&#39;s greatest offensive player. He is nearly 35, he has undergone a
major hip surgery, and, it must be said, he is no longer a user of PEDs -- at
least, we must assume that he is not. He is now just a very dangerous hitter
-- perhaps Top 20, no longer Top 1. But what he has gone through between home
runs 500 and 600 -- what, more properly, he put himself through -- has left
him accepting of that, comfortable being what he is, and no longer
desperately trying to convince himself and others that he is something even
more. It has quite obviously been freeing for him. &#34;I&#39;m a little more
relaxed,&#34; he said the other day, simply. We saw that last October, when he
all at once cast off his reputation as a postseason choker and slugged six
homers and drove in 18 runs in leading the Yankees to a World Series title --
their 27th, his first.

In between home runs 500 and 600, A-Rod the legend has died -- for us and for
him -- and Alex Rodriguez the man was revealed. And it&#39;s Alex Rodriguez the
man who will chase 700 home runs, and 763, and on from there.
