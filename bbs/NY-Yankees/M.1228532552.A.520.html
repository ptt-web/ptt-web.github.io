While speaking to PEOPLE about his latest charitable efforts, Yankees
star Alex Rodriguez commented for the first time on his relationship
with Madonna.

&#34;We&#39;re friends,&#34; Rodriguez, 33, says.

Asked if there is any romance between them at all, Rodriguez reiterates,
&#34;We&#39;re friends – that&#39;s it.&#34;

While rumors have swirled that the slugger and the singer, 50, have been
carrying on a romantic relationship and flying around the country in order
to spend time together, &#34;I can tell you this,&#34; Rodriguez says, &#34;I have never
been on a plane with her.&#34;

He also finds much of what&#39;s been written about them laughable: &#34;I&#39;ve been
to two [of her] concerts, yet I&#39;ve read that I went to 20. I&#39;ve also read
that we were buying an apartment together. That is absolutely ridiculous and
not true.&#34;

&#34;You have to have a sense of humor when it comes to this stuff,&#34; Rodriguez
adds.

When pressed on how much time they have spent together, and whether he had
ever stayed the night at Madonna&#39;s home, Rodriguez laughed: &#34;If I answered
every rumor we&#39;d be here for three weeks.&#34;

(A source close to Rodriguez tells PEOPLE that reports of his spending the
night with Madonna are &#34;completely, unequivocably false.&#34;)


Focused on Charity

While Rodriguez and Madonna were both in Mexico City last weekend, Rodriguez
says his time was focused on running a baseball clinic for kids.

&#34;When you&#39;re among 200 kids and teaching the game of baseball it gives you
an amazing feeling,&#34; he says, &#34;just that you may inspire kids to reach their
goals, whether it&#39;s baseball or whatever their goals might be.&#34;

The desire to help children is something he and Madonna have in common – and
one reason he has become a supporter of Madonna&#39;s Raising Malawi charity.

&#34;I initially knew nothing about her charity,&#34; Rodriguez says. But after being
invited to one of Madonna&#39;s fundraisers, he found that &#34;we shared a lot of the
same commitments toward helping children. I was very moved by the whole thing.
I saw the documentary and it was very inspiring and informative. I saw an
opportunity to help and I jumped at that.&#34;

Rodriguez jumped into three other philanthropic efforts on his own recently as
well: He&#39;s funding the completion of a Pediatric Outpatient Unit at
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in New York City; funding a Community DentCare
Network at Columbia University College of Dental Medicine (to provide
preventative dental services for kids); and completing a new learning center
at the Boys and Girls Club in Miami that A-Rod himself frequented as a child.

&#34;If it wasn&#39;t for the Boys and Girls Club, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am today,&#34;
Rodriguez says. &#34;So I feel a great responsibility to not only give money, but
to be there, and to be seen by the kids. I still hang out at the Boys and Girls
Club.&#34;


Dealing With His Divorce

Rodriguez, who amicably settled his divorce with wife Cynthia, 35, in September
, also addressed rumors that he and Cynthia had been arguing.

&#34;I have a wonderful relationship with Cynthia,&#34; says Rodriguez, who shared
 Thanksgiving dinner with his ex and their two children, Natasha, 4, and Ella,
 7 months, last week. &#34;We try to be the best parents we can.&#34;

As for the amount of time he spends with his children, &#34;I see my children,
honestly, seven days a week, which has been great. We both have a lot of
respect for each other and she&#39;s a great lady.&#34;

As for Madonna: &#34;I have a lot of respect for her,&#34; he says. &#34;She&#39;s very
committed to making the world a better place. She&#39;s had an amazing career,
and we&#39;re friends. That&#39;s it.&#34;

A-Rod開始澄清他跟瑪丹娜的關係XD

A-Rod重申說他跟瑪丹娜只是朋友,之前甚麼謠言都是假的

並且談到有關他的慈善活動,上禮拜周末跟瑪丹娜在一起在墨西哥,

他只將重心放在指導小朋友打棒球

反正他就bala bala講一堆他的慈善活動,還說他感恩節跟他兒女度過

另外他說他跟他前妻關係還是很好,他們彼此互相尊重.同樣的他對瑪丹那也是很尊敬

反正他們就只是朋友
