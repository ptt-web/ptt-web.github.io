Girardi might go with 3-man rotation

ESPN.com news services                  Originally Published: October 13, 2009


NEW YORK -- Barring a change of heart, the Yankees are expected to go with a
three-man rotation against the Los Angeles Angels in the AL Championship Series.

CC Sabathia is scheduled to start Friday night&#39;s opener, with A.J. Burnett
and Andy Pettitte as New York&#39;s other two primary starters. The shortened
rotation would allow manager Joe Girardi to keep Joba Chamberlain and
Chad Gaudin in the bullpen.

&#34;It looks like we have some rain in the forecast, so that can change things,&#34;
Girardi said Tuesday during a conference call. &#34;We are definitely considering
possibly going to a three-man rotation in this round, but we&#39;ll have to take
a look at it and see how it goes.&#34;

New York swept Minnesota in the opening round and used Chamberlain as a setup
man in all three games. He pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings, allowing two hits,
and combined with Phil Hughes and the rest of the bullpen to bolster the link
between starters and closer Mariano Rivera.

&#34;That was pretty good with us in the first round,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;If you go
to a three-man rotation, obviously he stays in the bullpen. But if you go to
a four-man rotation, then we have to weigh the benefits of either putting
Joba in the bullpen or putting Chad in the bullpen.&#34;

Sabathia made his final three regular-season starts for Milwaukee on three
days&#39; rest in 2008, then started again on short rest in the playoffs against
Philadelphia. He lasted just 3 2/3 innings and lost to the Phillies.

New York limited him to 230 innings during the regular season -- down from
253 the previous year. He will start the opener against the Angels on eight
days&#39; rest, another factor the Yankees think will enable him to be effective
in Game 4.

&#34;Not getting him to 250 innings during the regular season allows us to consider
that,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;We&#39;ve told him, though, to concentrate on Game 1. That&#39;s
the most important game, and we&#39;ll go from there.&#34;

While Sabathia was 19-8 overall, he went 0-2 with a 6.08 ERA in two starts
against the Angels. He threw a bullpen session Tuesday, and several Yankees
relievers also pitched in an attempt to stay sharp: Alfredo Aceves, Phil Coke,
Gaudin, Damaso Marte and David Robertson.

Because the Angels have far more switch-hitters (Erick Aybar, Chone Figgins,
Maicer Izturis, Gary Matthews Jr., Kendry Morales and Reggie Willits) than
left-handed hitters (Bobby Abreu), the Yankees might drop the left-handed
Marte in favor of right-hander Brian Bruney, who has been working out at the
team&#39;s complex in Tampa, Fla.

&#34;We&#39;ll talk about if guys are stronger from the right side or left side,&#34;
Girardi said. &#34;Bruney is a guy we sent down there because we believe that he&#39;s
still in the mix.&#34;

Girardi hasn&#39;t decided whether to again have Jose Molina catch Burnett instead
of Jorge Posada. To do that, Girardi said he probably would have to again
carry Francisco Cervelli as a third catcher, allowing the team to take out
Posada for a pinch runner late in a game.

Catchers could be a key in the series. The Angels were perfect in nine stolen
base attempts against the Yankees as the teams split 10 games during the
regular season.

&#34;I think the focus when you play the Angels is not to get wrapped up in their
running game, because they&#39;re going to run,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;And the bottom
line is you&#39;ve got to keep making pitches. And when you get your focus so
much on the running game, you don&#39;t make the pitches that you need to make.&#34;

Notes
Johnny Damon, 1 for 12 with no RBIs against in the first round, took batting
practice against the pitchers Tuesday along with backups Cervelli,
Brett Gardner, Jerry Hairston Jr. and Eric Hinske. &#34;I don&#39;t make too much of
10, 12 at-bats,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;We know that Johnny can get real hot, real
fast.&#34; ... Nick Swisher took BP in a cage.
