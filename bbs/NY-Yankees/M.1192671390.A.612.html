Building the 2008 New York Yankees
Filed under: 2007-2008 Offseason, Special Posts — johnbutchko @ 8:51 pm

It is that time of year again. In what has become a tradition on this
blog, I will now pretend to be Brian Cashman and guide the Yankees
through the offseason, building a contender for Spring Training.

Disclaimer: I have done a great deal of reading to see where teams stand
and what it would take to get the players I will acquire. Based on that
buzz, I feel confident that all of my transactions are reasonable.
Although my readers will almost certainly find some of these
transactions implausible, I have good reason to believe that they are
all possible.

Sign Joe Torre to a 2 year/$10 million contract:

Torre certainly has flaws, but he is still the best manager for this
team. He got a team full of high-priced veterans to fight through a
rough start this year, caused by an inordinate number of injuries to the
pitching staff, when they could have just packed in their season. If
motivating players like that was easy, Ozzie Guillen would have never
let the White Sox fall into the tank. Joe helps to shield his players
from the expectations of a maniacal owner and base of fans, who demand
nothing but excellence. His faults in handling the bullpen and staying
too loyal to veterans are overblown by his detractors. This team has had
nothing other than astounding success under Torre. It has never missed
the postseason under Joe’s watch. No candidate to replace him could
handle this team as well as Joe Torre. His pitching let him down in the
postseason. Firing him for failing to get past Cleveland would be
totally unfair. It was not his fault that Chien-Ming Wang laid a pair of
eggs. He is a 19 game winner. The team may not have won the World Series
in seven years, but it is not as easy to win it all as Joe made it look
early in his tenure. With no obvious qualified successor, any change
would be made for the sake of change. That is always a bad idea. Torre
can take a paycut because he was making a ridiculous amount of money
compared with other skippers, but he should stay.

Hire Leo Mazzone as pitching coach and reassign Ron Guidry to work in
the minor leagues:

This move is not a reflection on Guidry’s work. He has done a fine job
in his two years as pitching coach. Mazzone just might be the best ever
and is now a free agent. Mazzone has an astounding track record in
working with young pitchers. He has developed Tom Glavine, John Smoltz,
and Erik Bedard. He also has worked wonders with numerous pitchers
possessing good stuff, who could never seem to put it together without
him. Jaret Wright, John Burkett, Mike Remlinger, and Chris Hammond are
examples. His Baltimore pitching staffs struggled because he had very
little with which to work. He still got great results from Bedard, Adam
Loewen, and Jeremy Guthrie. There are studies out showing that the
pitchers he has coached have been significantly better with Mazzone than
they were with others. There is no better mentor for the young pitchers
the Yankees have. Guidry has been a positive influence for the
organization’s pitching talent so he can share his knowledge for
prospects with a reduced workload. The team might offer him a raise for
him to step aside.

Hire Trey Hillman as bench coach:

Hillman was an extremely successful manager for the Yankees’ minor
league system for almost a decade. He won three Minor League Manager of
the Year Awards. He then went to Japan and won the Japan Series in 2006.
Hillman has announced that he will return to the states over family
concerns and will seek a job in some capacity with a Major League team.
Hillman has been successful everywhere he has gone. He has a brilliant
baseball mind. At times, he has been called too calculating as his
devotion to putting the best team on the field has rubbed players he
benched the wrong way. He can focus on strategy, which is a strength.
Joe Torre is a master of dealing with personalities. This will give the
team another strong voice with a different perspective in a position of
power. Hillman and Torre would make a good team. Hillman understands the
culture with the Yankees and wants to become a Major League manager.
This would be a great platform to get his name known better.

Name Don Mattingly manager of the Trenton Thunder:

Mattingly wants to manage the Yankees. He is going to have to pay his
dues. The first thing he needs to do is get some managerial experience.
Taking over New York’s AA affiliate will allow him to learn what goes
into running a team. He can work through some of his growing pains in
obscurity. Managing the Yankees is tough enough without having to learn
on the job. This will allow Don to cut his teeth as a manager.

Sign Mariano Rivera to a 2 year/$26 million contract:

Mo says that he wants to be the closer when the Yankees open their new
stadium in 2009. There is no reason to not honor that wish. After a
rough start to the year, Mariano looked as good as ever to finish. New
York’s bullpen is rather thin even with him. It would be frightening to
imagine filling the hole that the greatest closer ever would leave.

Sign Jorge Posada to a 3 year/$42 million contract:

Jorge had a monster year at age 36. It is unlikely that a catcher of his
age will ever approach numbers like that again. The Yankees still have
to resign him. There are no options on the open market or within the
organization that will approach his production from the catcher
position. This does not even touch on the leadership he provides within
the locker room. The Yanks would be foolish to let Jorge get away.

Sign Alex Rodriguez to a 7 year/$210 million contract extension:

This one could go either way, but the Yankees would be wise to lock up
A-Rod before he hits the market. Anybody who says that the Yankees
cannot afford to lose Alex is being silly. He could not have done more
early in the year, and the team still struggled. When New York turned
things around after the All-Star break, Rodriguez was not doing anything
terribly special with the bat. It was mainly that Hideki Matsui, Bobby
Abreu, and Robinson Cano started hitting. With that said, A-Rod is going
to be very tough to replace. There are not many good options out on the
market. Mike Lowell would probably be the best, and he will demand far
more than he is worth after a monster contract year. He is also nowhere
near the player that Rodriguez is. Losing A-Rod would cost the team its
only source of power from the right side, making New York extremely
vulnerable to lefty pitching. The Yanks would also have to replace his
stellar defense at third with a pitching staff that will rely heavily on
groundball pitchers. A-Rod is a superstar in the prime of his career. He
is a first ballot Hall of Famer. He might not be the only reason that
people come to see the Yankees, but it is not an accident that the team
’s attendance has spiked since he joined the team. People take their
kids just to see A-Rod play. Keeping him would guarantee that people
would look back at these Yankees as having the greatest left side of an
infield ever. With his 9th inning heroics and solid postseason, Alex
seems to have overcome the pressure and stigma that daunted him earlier
in his tenure in New York. The Yanks should make sure that one of the
greatest players ever ends his career with the greatest franchise in
baseball, where he is likely to age gracefully. Things look bright for
A-Rod in New York. Even if everything heads south, he still will have a
lot of trade value. New York should be proactive and get this done
before he opts out of his contract so that Texas will still foot some of
the bill for the next three years. It is not that the Yanks cannot live
without A-Rod. Life is just much easier with him.

Exercise Bobby Abreu’s team option for 2008:

Abreu is a perfect fit for this team. He does not cause a stir in the
clubhouse and seems undeterred by big market pressure. He wears out
pitchers with his amazing selectivity at the plate. He gets on base. He
plays a decent rightfield and owns a strong arm. Even though he looked
utterly lost for about a month in an unfathomable slump this year, he
still recovered to post really good numbers, including 101 RBI’s. Abreu
is a perfect third hitter. Nobody available is a better option.

Let Luis Vizcaino leave via free agency:

2007 was an up and down year for Vizcaino. He is a solid reliever, but
the Yankees will be able to replace his production in cheaper ways.
Letting Vizcaino leave for greener pastures will also likely net the
club a pair of picks in the 2008 MLB Draft for compensation. This can
help stock the farm system.

Sign Jose Molina to a 2 year/$4 million contract:

Molina is the best backup catcher the Yankees have had since Joe
Girardi. His hitting is adequate compared to other backup catchers
across baseball. Even when he is not hitting, he still has value because
of the way he handles a pitching staff, his ability to throw out
runners, and his overall defense. Few are better behind the plate. He
can help take some of Posada’s load as Jorge ages.

Pray that Andy Pettitte exercises his player option for 2008:

Pettitte picked up right where he left off with the Yankees. He provided
necessary stability at the front of the rotation. He came through
multiple times to end losing streaks, and his performance in Game 2 of
the ALDS at Cleveland was a masterpiece. Andy seems to thrive on
pressure. He loves pitching in New York as much as Carl Pavano shies
away from it. It will be tough to replace a guy of his value.

Offer Ron Villone a nonroster invitation to Spring Training:

Villone loves being a Yankee. He took a nonroster invite to attend
Spring Training in 2007, even when he had other offers. He would likely
do the same in 2008. The Yankees should not commit anything to an up and
down pitcher, but it would be worth a look to see whether a veteran guy
has anything left in the tank.

Let Doug Mientkiewicz leave via free agency:

Doug did an admirable job in September, but there are better first
basemen to be had. The Yankees already have Andy Phillips, essentially
the same player, under their control for cheaper than it would be to
retain Doug.

Make Hideki Matsui the permanent designated hitter:

Matsui’s defense has gone downhill as he has aged. He turns too many
routine flyballs into adventures and has limited range. Hideki might not
be a major liability, but he is below average in the field. He is still
a potent hitter and has taken to the DH role. Having him DH will limit
the wear and tear on his aging body.

Trade Johnny Damon (with $13 million) to the Braves for Joey Devine and
Scott Thorman:

The Braves need a replacement for Andruw Jones. They showed interest in
Damon during the season. The sticking point was money. Johnny has served
the Yankees well, but his body is breaking down. He has played through
injuries in the past three years. His all out play is catching up with
him as he ages. The time to deal him is now because his value is still
high. If subsidizing half of his deal means getting something of value
back, the Yanks should do it. Devine is a flamethrowing reliever with
closer potential. He dominated AA and AAA last year and pitched very
well in a brief Major League stint. He should be ready to contribute in
a Major League bullpen in 2008. Thorman is a first base prospect. He
will be 26 on Opening Day and projects as a potential fifth hitter. He
struggled in 2007 with the Braves but still has potential. The lefty
would be a good fit for Yankee Stadium. Atlanta’s addition of Mark
Teixeira makes him expendable. The Braves have never been shy about
dealing their prospects. If they can get Damon at a reasonable price,
they will make sure the deal gets done.

Trade Matt DeSalvo to the Nationals for Nick Johnson:

The Nats have no room for Johnson. Nick missed the entire 2007 season
due to complications from a broken leg. He is set to make $5.5 million,
and Washington has Dmitri Young to man first base. Since he is coming
off a serious injury, his trade value is nonexistent. This is the kind
of gamble a big market team can take. Nick has a great eye at the plate.
His career on base percentage is .395. He posted a .428 on base
percentage in 2006. He also played great defense at first base, although
it remains unseen how the injury will affect him in the field. He will
only be 29 years old on Opening Day. This deal would be low-risk,
high-reward. If Johnson can come close to his old production, New York
’s lineup gets much deeper and gains yet another grinder. The Yankees
could utilize Shelley Duncan and Wilson Betemit to take some games at
first and keep Johnson fresh. Washington will likely only ask for a
marginal prospect like DeSalvo just to free up some money. They are so
desperate for pitching that DeSalvo could conceivably crack their 2008
rotation.

Trade Kyle Farnsworth (with $4 million) and Brian Bruney to the Devil
Rays for Rocco Baldelli:

The Devil Rays have no real use for the oft-injured Baldelli now that
B.J. Upton has emerged as an outfielder. Like Johnson, Baldelli has been
slowed by injuries and has little trade value. He could be a free agent
next year if the Devil Rays turn down a lucrative club option. Given his
injury problems and the current makeup of their team, the Rays really
have no choice but to do so. That means the time is now for them to move
Rocco. In return, they would get some desperately needed bullpen help.
Farnsworth was never a good fit in New York, given his personality. In
the laid back atmosphere of Tampa Bay, he could emerge as a top closer
and bring back a lot for the Rays in a deadline deal to a contender.
Bruney has been inconsistent but also has a ton of potential. He
certainly represents an upgrade over what the Devil Rays have now.
Baldelli is a terrific athlete capable of playing all three outfield
positions. He is only 26 years old and has room to develop. Rocco has
the talent to become a 20-20 man in centerfield (some think 30-30 is his
ceiling). He is worth the risk for a pair of relievers with attitude
problems. He would be a terrific fourth outfielder. In a backup role,
the Yankees could limit his playing time, reducing the risk of injury.
Even with the money sent with Farnsworth, Baldelli would cost about the
same as having Farnsworth and Bruney. He is more likely to contribute in
a positive way.

Engineer a three way trade with the Yankees receiving Jon Garland, Adam
Eaton, Michael Bourn, and Scott Mathieson the Phillies receiving Mike
Mussina, and the White Sox receiving Pat Burrell:

Mike Mussina has been wonderful for the Yankees, but he was very up and
down in 2007. He could probably be an adequate fifth starter in 2008,
but his diminished stuff would serve him better against the weaker
lineups in the National League. The Phillies are looking for starting
pitching. Moose would likely waive his no-trade clause to go to
Philadelphia because it is a bit closer to his Montoursville,
Pennsylvania, home than New York is. In the process, the Phils would
free up funds for their free agent shopping by dealing Burrell, a guy
they have been trying to dump for a while, to the White Sox, a team in
need of some offensive punch in the outfield. The White Sox have been
inclined to deal Garland and his hefty $12 million salary for some time.
The Yanks pick him up. There is a temptation to put Ian Kennedy into the
rotation along with Phil Hughes and Joba Chamberlain. It certainly would
be fun to see a big three of young homegrown Yankees in 2008, but that
would be a mistake. All of these young pitchers are going to need to be
on limited innings to protect their developing arms. Three pitchers on
pitch counts would put a big load onto the bullpen. Instead, the Yankees
could use Garland as a fifth starter. Garland is a 28 year old innings
eater. He threw 208.1 innings in 2007, his lowest total since 2003. He
also has big game experience. Garland is not the ace he looked like in
2005, but he would be one of the league’s best fifth starters. The
Yankees also take Eaton off Philadelphia’s hands. Eaton signed a big
contract prior to the season but was awful. Mussina’s and Eaton’s
salaries are almost a wash. Because the Yankees absorbed Eaton in this
salary dump, the Phillies will throw in Michael Bourn, a speedy 24 year
old capable of playing all three outfield positions, and Mathieson, a
pitcher coming back from Tommy John surgery who could develop into a 2
starter or a closer.

Trade Adam Eaton (with $8 million) to the Rockies for Jeff Baker:

The Rockies are going to look for starting pitching depth over the
offseason. They could be inclined to think that a pitcher with Eaton’s
stuff needs a change of scenery and that returning to the National
League West would do him well. With the Yankees picking up half of his
salary, he would become quite affordable. Baker is a 26 year old with a
nice righty bat, capable of playing corner infield and corner outfield
positions. He could prove to be quite valuable for the Yanks.

Trade Jason Giambi (with $11 million) to the Angels for Tom Mendoza and
Jose Arredondo:

The Yankees do not really have a spot for Giambi. He is still a feared
hitter, but he cannot play the field at all, limiting the team’s
flexibility. After yet another early exit, the Angels are going to push
hard to upgrade their offense. Giambi has a home in Southern California,
making it likely he would waive his no-trade clause. The Yankees could
also play hardball, informing him that he will be a bench player if he
refuses to waive it. Hideki Matsui’s longer contract dictates that he
has more of a future on the club than Giambi. If Alex Rodriguez is off
the table, the Angels will have to go back to the drawing board. With a
subsidy, Giambi becomes an attractive option. He is a better clubhouse
guy and has less baggage than Barry Bonds would. Jason did have an
injury-plagued 2007 that affected his production, but the Yankees were
still able to get a big return for Gary Sheffield a year ago under
similar circumstances. The Angels have a ton of young pitching. They
could part with some of it to give their lineup more punch. Arredondo is
a converted shortstop with a very live fastball and is developing
secondary pitches. His ceiling is very high, and it appears he is
starting to put it all together after a strong season of pitching in the
minors. Mendoza is not that close to the Majors but has an excellent
fastball and a plus curve. If he can improve his control and command, he
will become a quality hurler in short order.

Sign Kosuke Fukudome to a 4 year/$52 million contract:

Fukudome is the latest Japanese star primed to make the jump to America.
He is a .305 career hitter in Japan, but his patience makes him stand
out. Fukudome has not posted an on base percentage lower than .430 since
2005. It was .443 in 2007. Fukudome wears out pitchers and extends
innings. Many Japanese sluggers struggle with the longer fences in
America, but Fukudome has a line drive stroke, which will make him a
prolific gap to gap doubles hitter. Fukudome is capable of playing an
adequate centerfield, but he would shift to left with the Yankees. He
would be phenomenal defensively as a corner outfielder as he has good
range and a rocket for an arm. He also would have a mentor, Hideki
Matsui, to aid his transition to the Majors. Fukudome is something of an
unknown, which will make him cheaper than most free agent outfielders.
Kosuke has enough service time to become a free agent so there will be
no posting fee. He keeps a low profile as well. He is all business when
he comes to the ballpark. Fukudome would be a perfect fit for the Yanks.

Sign Hitoki Iwase to a 3 year/$18 million contract:

Iwase might go down as the greatest closer in Japanese baseball history.
Like his teammate with the Chunichi Dragons, Fukudome, the lefty is a
free agent, meaning no posting fee. He throws a fastball in the low 90
’s and a devastating slider in the mid 80’s. Iwase can be a top setup
man in America. Even though Japanese starters have had mixed results in
the Major Leagues, the success rate is much higher for relievers
(Hasegawa, Sasaki, Saito, Okajima, etc.).

Trade Kei Igawa to the Padres for Cla Meredith:

Igawa was an enormous disappointment. His funky delivery and success
pitching on short notice against Boston in April and Tampa Bay in
September suggest that he might be better suited for a relief role, but
the Yankees can find similar production from somebody else for cheaper.
San Diego indicated interest in Igawa during the season. In a park built
for flyball pitchers and against weaker competition, Igawa might be a
viable option for the Padres. In exchange, the Yankees will get
Meredith, the former Boston farmhand, who has pitched well in two years
for the Padres. He came back down to earth in 2007 after a dominant 2006
but is still a viable bullpen arm. There are reports that San Diego was
willing to part with him for Igawa back in August.

Sign Mark Prior to a 2 year/$10 million contract:

The Cubs are likely to nontender Prior. This move might elicit some
groans given his injury history, but Prior has a lot of upside. His
first few injuries were not serious or recurring. Over the past three
years, he was plagued by shoulder issues that the Cubs never properly
diagnosed or treated until James Andrews saw them and did corrective
surgery. For the first time in a while, he is actually healthy. His
fastball might go down in velocity, but it still will be a viable weapon
to go with an outstanding curve and changeup. He is only going to be 27.
He has time to regain the form that had him as an elite prospect. This
is another instance where a big market team can gamble. Since the Yanks
will have plenty of rotation depth, they can bring Prior along slowly.
He can start either in the minors or as a long man out of the bullpen.
If they can build him up to take a rotation spot, this signing can
become a coup. If not, only money will be lost.

Trade Jose Arrodondo, Scott Mathieson, Edwar Ramirez, and Kevin Whelan,
and Brett Gardner to the Athletics for Huston Street:

The Athletics are in rebuilding mode. Street is eligible for
arbitration. Billy Beane has never been opposed to dealing a successful
closer before for a good package. He gets a lot in return for his closer
in this deal. Oakland receives a quartet of promising pitching prospects
here as well as a quality prospect for centerfield in Gardner. None of
these players have any Major League service time so the A’s can control
them for some time. The Yankees give up a lot, but they do have a
surplus of pitching depth in the minors. They can absorb this hit.
Gardner is promising, but the team also has Melky Cabrera as well as
Austin Jackson and Jose Tabata remaining in the system. It is also easy
to find bats. Street has established himself as an elite closer at age
24. His strikeout rate just jumped into double-digits in 2007. He is
going to be a top short reliever for a long time. He would immediately
become the favorite to succeed Mariano Rivera. Games would essentially
be over after 6 innings with an Iwase-Street-Rivera combination to close
them out. The Yanks have a lot of quality young bullpen options, but it
will be good to have another proven guy in there.

Move Joba Chamberlain into the rotation:

All of the bullpen additions free up Joba to step into a starting role.
That is ideal for the team. It is easier to find a guy with 2 above
average pitches to make a dominant reliever than it is to find a guy
with 4 above average pitches to make a dominant starter. The biggest
reason that the Yanks have failed to win a World Series since 2000 has
been starting pitching. They have lacked a plethora of shutdown starters
to go toe to toe with opposing aces. Chien-Ming Wang is a terrific
pitcher, but he is not a shutdown ace. The easiest way for the Yanks to
find one is through the farm system. Joba has already displayed a
mastery of Major League hitters, and Phil Hughes posted a 2.35 ERA in
September as his velocity returned in addition to his brilliant
postseason long relief. Both are good bets to become frontline starters
in 2008. Hughes-Chamberlain could become the game’s top 1-2 punch for
years to come.

Convert Humberto Sanchez into a reliever:

Sanchez is one of the high ceiling prospects that the Yanks acquired in
the Gary Sheffield trade. He has been plagued by injuries during his
career, never throwing more than 116 innings in a season. He has a fresh
start in 2007, coming off Tommy John surgery to fix his elbow. The
Yankees have quality starting depth. He has a big fastball and a quality
slider. To develop into a top starter, his changeup will need
development, but he can make a quicker impact as a reliever. Relief work
also will limit the wear and tear on Humberto. Depending on how quickly
he and J. Brent Cox recover from Tommy John surgery, either could make
positive contributions to the 2008 bullpen late in the year. Humberto is
looking at 2009 to do anything in New York as a starter as his stuff
would still need refinement.

Convert Chase Wright into a reliever:

Wright is not going to make any lasting impact for this organization as
a starter. He does not throw a breaking pitch and has numerous talented
pitchers behind him. The lefty has enjoyed great success in the minors
against lefties. He might have a future as a situational reliever at
some point in 2008 or beyond.

Promote Chris Britton:

Britton posted a 3.35 ERA in the American League East for the Orioles in
2006. He posted a 2.51 ERA pitching most of the season in AAA in 2007.
He has nothing left to prove. Britton can be a weapon against righties
in the back of the bullpen.

There you have it. I feel that all of my moves are realistic, and I have
improved the rotation, the bullpen, and the organization’s overall
depth. Despite the Igawa trade, the additions of Hillman, Fukudome, and
Iwase provide a Japansese flavor. In conclusion, the 2008 New York
Yankees:
