According to Bob Klapisch, the Yankees are getting close to a deal with lefty
reliever Pedro Feliciano. Our anonymous source that’s both close to the
situation and a friend of someone involved in he negotiations who asked not
to be named but is a baseball person confirms that the two sides are close.
Terms of the deal are unknown, but Scott Downs got three years and $15M while
Randy Choate got two years and $2.5M, so I bet it’s somewhere between the
two. With any luck, it’ll be a one year deal.

This move should come as no surprise. We first heard that the Yankees were
interested in Feliciano one month ago today, and then learned that they had
met with his agent at the winter meetings last week. Brian Cashman declared
that acquiring a second lefty was one of his offseason priorities, but it
appears that he is not content with Rule 5 Draft selection Robert Fish, or
minor league signings Andy Sisco and Neal Cotts.
