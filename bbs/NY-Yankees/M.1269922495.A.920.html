Horne’s long road continues

Just rolled into Sarasota where the wind is howling out to center field.
Even I could hit a ball at least over the second baseman’s head (my baseball
goals are very low).

The big pitching news of the day out of Yankees camp has to be Alfredo Aceves
and his balky back, but the big news out of the minor league complex is
Alan Horne and his torn rotator cuff.

“It never felt great last year,” Horne said. “But that was to be expected.
I took a break this fall before I began to really get after it in the weight
room. It felt great and I started throwing around December 1. It felt fine
for the first two months but started to go downhill fast at the beginning of
spring.”

Horne had mild shoulder surgery after the 2008 season. He tried to pitch last
year, but the shoulder and a strained hamstring limited him to 14 outings
between rookie ball and Double-A. He’s now scheduled for surgery with
Dr. Andrews on April 9, and it will definitely knock him out for the season.
When he can get back on a depends on the severity of the injury.

“I honestly have no idea until he gets in there and sees how bad things are
and what time of repair has to be made,” Horne said. “All of that
determines down time.”

Back in 2007, Horne was outstanding in the Double-A Eastern League. He went
12-4 with a 3.11 ERA and 165 strikeouts in 153.1 innings and was named the
league’s Pitcher of the Year. In 2008 he ranked ahead of Jesus Montero,
Brett Gardner, Ross Ohlendorf and Andrew Brackman on Baseball America’s
Yankees prospect list, and he might have been one of the slew of big league
call-ups that year had he not strained his biceps in his second Triple-A
start.

“It’s been a long road for me over the past 10 years,” Horne said.

When he’s been healthy, Horne has been a young pitcher on a no-doubt course
to the big leagues, but his body has had  way of letting him down. He’s
already come back from Tommy John surgery, now he’ll have to come back from
this.

I’ll have more on it later tonight, but former Eastern League Pitcher of
the Year Alan Horne is scheduled for rotator cuff surgery on April 9. He has
more than an 80 percent tear. It’s a brutal blow for a very good pitcher
who’s had trouble staying healthy the past two years.
