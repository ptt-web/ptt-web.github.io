Joba not expected back for Sox series
Yankees reliever remains in Nebraska with ailing father
By Bryan Hoch / MLB.com


ST. PETERSBURG -- Joba Chamberlain is not expected to rejoin the Yankees in
time to appear in the club&#39;s series against the Red Sox this week, manager
Joe Girardi said on Tuesday.
Chamberlain, 22, left the team after Sunday&#39;s game to return home, where his
father, Harlan, was listed in critical but stable condition at Saint
Elizabeth Regional Medical Center in Lincoln, Neb.

The right-hander has been placed on the Major League bereavement list, making
him ineligible to play for a minimum of three games. The Yankees play the Red
Sox in New York on Wednesday and Thursday.

&#34;Of course he wants to be here,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;He understands what he needs
to do as a son. Joba is very mature and Joba has been through a lot in his
lifetime. You only have so many days with the people that you love, so you&#39;ve
got to make sure you&#39;re where you&#39;re supposed to be at the right times.&#34;

Girardi said that he spoke with Chamberlain on Tuesday and that the elder
Chamberlain was doing &#34;a little better,&#34; but that more tests still needed to
be conducted.

A retired prison counselor, the 55-year-old Chamberlain has coped with health
issues for most of his life. He was stricken with polio as a child and
utilizes a motorized scooter for transportation.

&#34;Joba is by his side and just praying that he gets better,&#34; Girardi said.
&#34;He&#39;s doing OK. He understands that it&#39;s important for him to be there. He&#39;s
taking care of Pops.&#34;

There is no timetable for Chamberlain&#39;s return to the Yankees. The club
recalled right-hander Jonathan Albaladejo from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre
on Monday to take Chamberlain&#39;s place in the bullpen.

&#34;He can take as long as he needs to take,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;There&#39;s nothing
more important.&#34;

That creates an issue for the Yankees on the field, however. As he was during
the second half last season, Chamberlain was a trusted and dominant cog in
New York&#39;s bullpen earlier this month, throwing 5 1/3 scoreless innings and
striking out six in four appearances.

With Chamberlain removed from the roster, the Yankees need to find other ways
to get the ball to closer Mariano Rivera. Had the Yankees gone forward with
Chamberlain as a starting pitcher this year, an idea they originally flirted
with, LaTroy Hawkins and Kyle Farnsworth would have filled the eighth-inning
mix.

Though the team considers Billy Traber a left-handed specialist, Girardi said
that right-hander Brian Bruney -- who allowed two home runs in a 1 1/3-inning
appearance against the Rays on Monday, but has a 2.16 ERA in six appearances
-- could find his way into the arrangement as well.

&#34;Other guys need to step up,&#34; Girardi said. &#34;That&#39;s the reality of baseball
-- it happens all the time. [Derek] Jeter went down and [Alberto] Gonzalez
stepped up. Jorge [Posada] went down and [Jose] Molina stepped up. It&#39;s no
different when it&#39;s a pitcher. Someone has to step up and I expect our guys
to do it.&#34;
