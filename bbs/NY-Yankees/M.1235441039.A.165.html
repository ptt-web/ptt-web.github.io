洋基今天放假，去打撞球。

School’s out for the Yankees

Joe Girardi just called off the workout. The entire team and coaching staff
will instead head to a local pool hall for a tournament and lunch.

With games starting Wednesday, Girardi decided to give his team a break and
build some chemistry at the same time. This is part of what I wrote about in
yesterday’s paper, Girardi improving his relationship with the players.

Back with some more later. To me, this is a great idea. Right out of the
Tom Coughlin playbook.

UPDATE, 10:36 a.m.:

The Yankees are out of here, off to play pool. They’re going to be
partnered up with a teammate and play some 8 Ball.

“It’s a team day away from the field. We’re going to have a little
tournament and try to enjoy the day,” Girardi said.

Coughlin, as you may remember, took the Giants bowling during training
camp in 2007. Next thing you know, they won the Super Bowl. Was there a
connection? Maybe not a direct one; but building relationships is an
important aspect of success.

The players were laughing as they walked to the bus. Jorge Posada stopped
to speak to the writers and he said he thought it was a good idea.

“It’s good to get together,” he said. “It’s something you don’t see
often. Being together away from the field, hopefully we start some
relationships here. … It’s a day to forget about baseball a little but
and think about the family we have. I think its good. It’s good for
everybody.”

So there you have it. No baseball today, just billiards. No press coverage,
either. But we’ll get a report later on and I’ll let you know what
happened. Word is that Brian Bruney is a serious player.

The Sandman rules in pool

The Yankees had two Eight-Ball tournaments. Mariano Rivera won both of
them, once paired with Phil Coke and the second time with Andy Pettitte.

There will be some quotes and some photos shortly.

UPDATE, 3:00 p.m.:

Via a pool reporter, some comments were obtained. Here is what Johnny Damon
had to say:

“It was a great day. We’ve been at spring training for a week and Joe
came up with a great idea to get us together as a team. It was great to
break up spring training a bit, get the team together, get some
camaraderie there.

“I think everybody had a great time. We got to see who’s been spending
too much time at the pool hall and we know the ones that don’t spend enough
time in there.

“For Joe to let us take a day off from practice like that, it makes you
want to work even harder for him.”

“Camp has been going great so far. We all have been rallying around each
other, having a good time in the clubhouse. Today is one of those days that,
as a ballplayer, you’ll never forget. I don’t think any team has ever
really done this. It’s a day I’ll never forget. It says a lot about Joe.
He knows we’ve been working hard and he rewarded us with a day off.”

Mark Teixeira:

“It was great. That was probably the most fun I’ve ever had in spring
training in my whole career.”

“I thought it was a great idea. We’ve been working really hard – the
pitchers a little bit longer than the position players. We had a good week
of practice and we’re going to start games here soon, so I think Joe just
wanted to give us some time off.”

“I’ve never have (heard of a team doing something like this), but I think
more teams should. This was a great time, great for all of us to get
together.”

“There were probably 16-18 pool tables, there were some card tables, we
had darts, we had guys playing dominos and we had lunch also. Everyone was
just having a good time.”

“It makes you relax and realize that we can have fun off the field. Once
we get on the field, it’s business, but we can build some relationships
as well.”

“Usually during the season, you get to hang out with guys because we’re
always on the same bus or the same plane. Our schedules are identical. In
spring training, you don’t go on trips together, the pitchers have
different schedules than the hitters and the hitters are in different
groups, so there might be a couple guys you don’t get to know at all.”

這篇 We’re gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool 是照片：


I can’t take credit for this headline. Noted Springsteen fan Connie Schwab
of the Yankees media relations department suggested it.

You should be able to identify everybody in the photos. That’s Phil Coke
with Mariano Rivera in the next-to-last shot and Jose Molina leaning over
the shoulder of A.J. Burnett. You can also see Andrew Brackman behind
Chien-Ming Wang.

Brackman was paired with Kei Igawa in the first tournament. Now there’s
an unlikely duo.
