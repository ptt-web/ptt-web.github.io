NEW YORK -- General manager Brian Cashman said on Thursday that he would
consider moving Robinson Cano from second to third base should the search for
Alex Rodriguez&#39;s successor prove fruitless through free agency. The two spoke
directly about the subject when Cano visited Yankee Stadium on Wednesday.
&#34;I was playful with him, but I informed him that I know he can play third
base,&#34; Cashman said. &#34;I know it. I&#39;m not saying that he&#39;s going to, but I
know he can do it.&#34;

Cashman&#39;s conversation with Cano was lighthearted, and he repeatedly
expressed his desire to keep Cano at second if at all possible. But it was a
conversation, nonetheless.

Cashman joked that if Cano wants to keep his spot at second -- and he stated
earlier this week that he does -- then he should encourage countryman Wilson
Betemit to train into peak shape this winter. Right now, Betemit is tops on
the depth chart at third base, though that could certainly change.

And Cano certainly has incentive to keep his name off the list.

&#34;I feel so comfortable at second base that right now I don&#39;t want to play
third base,&#34; Cano told Sirius Satellite Radio on Monday. &#34;That&#39;s something
that I don&#39;t want to do.&#34;

All the speculation would become moot if the Yankees can find a suitable
replacement through free agency. Yet the problem remains that this year&#39;s
market doesn&#39;t hold a glut of capable offensive third basemen.

Aside from A-Rod, whom the Yankees have insisted they won&#39;t pursue now that
he&#39;s opted out of the final three years of his contract, only one free agent
-- Boston&#39;s Mike Lowell -- jumps off the page. But thanks to a performance
this season that culminated in a World Series MVP, Lowell will certainly draw
continued interest from the Red Sox, who will have the inside track as his
former team.

So if the Yankees can&#39;t improve through the market, logic says they would
have to look internally. But perhaps not. If Cano moved to third base, they
could then pursue a second baseman through free agency. There aren&#39;t a host
of top-flight second basemen available -- Luis Castillo of the Mets and Kaz
Matsui of the Rockies head the list -- but second base is a position more
readily defined by defense than offense. The Yankees may be more willing to
take an offensive hit there than they would at third.

But moving Cano from second base, at least for now, remains a last resort.

&#34;He&#39;s a very talented kid, and because of the offense that he provides at
that position, I think it&#39;s in our best interest to leave him right where
he&#39;s at,&#34; Cashman said. &#34;But I do know he can play [third base]. I don&#39;t
doubt that. He&#39;s a quality athlete and I know that&#39;s something he&#39;s capable
of doing.&#34;
