DETROIT -- Brian Bruney rejoined the Yankees on Friday at Comerica Park,
re-inserted as a bullpen member after spending more than two weeks with the
club&#39;s Triple-A affiliate.

The call couldn&#39;t come soon enough for Bruney, who had a 3.40 ERA in 50
appearances for New York before being optioned on Aug. 7. He didn&#39;t take the
demotion well as he left Rogers Centre in Toronto, but had a more level
outlook upon his return.

&#34;I work here,&#34; Bruney said. &#34;I&#39;m an employee. I do what I&#39;m told. I&#39;m still
going to do my job wherever I&#39;m at. Obviously, I was upset, but who wouldn&#39;t
be?&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">Bruney, 25, was brought up from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre when left-hander Ron
</span><span class="f3 hl">Villone hit the 15-day disabled list with a mild lower back strain.</span>

The Yankees are optimistic that Bruney may be able to give them more length
as a result of his four-appearance Minor League stint. Bruney went two
innings in his final relief appearance for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Sunday.

His previous high this season was 1 2/3 innings on May 27, though the club
had tried to coax him through two innings on other occasions only to lift
him.

&#34;Hopefully, it&#39;s more of a weapon,&#34; Yankees manager Joe Torre said.

Part of the Yankees&#39; rationale for sending down Bruney revolved around his
control, which proved erratic at times. In 23 appearances from June 3 on,
Bruney walked 17 in 16 2/3 innings, striking out just eight.

The Yankees briefly instructed Bruney to try throwing from the windup to help
his control, a tweak that he said he feels comfortable with, though he
bristled at the idea that he was having difficulty throwing strikes.

&#34;I&#39;m a reliever,&#34; Bruney said. &#34;I can&#39;t come in and set it on a tee for a
guy. If that&#39;s what you want, I can give up hits all day, but sometimes I&#39;ve
got to try to get a strikeout.

&#34;You throw pitches that you think they&#39;re going to swing at, that not
necessarily are strikes. You try to make them look like them. The walks are
high, but it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know how to throw strikes.&#34;
