Season Over: Yankees Out, and Torre ...

Everything changes. Things fall apart. Summer does not last forever, though
it seemed that way at Yankee Stadium last night. It was 87 degrees at game
time, one last day of warmth, perhaps, for Joe Torre.

For 12 seasons, there was sunshine on his shoulders. But now there is
darkness, and the condemned old ballpark is shuttered again for the winter.
The Yankees are a first-round playoff casualty for the third October in a
row, and <span class="f3 hl">Torre will almost certainly lose his job as manager.</span>

The Cleveland Indians eliminated the Yankees, 6-4, in Game 4 of their
American League division series. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ owner,
was said to be fuming in his office.

The Indians will now play the Boston Red Sox in the A.L. Championship Series
starting Friday at Fenway Park.

Steinbrenner had already tied Torre’s future to the outcome of this series.
Torre became an icon — and a very wealthy man — while guiding Steinbrenner’
s players to four World Series titles. But the last was seven years ago, a
drought too long for a famously impatient owner.

Four of the unfulfilled seasons have come with the game’s best player, Alex
Rodriguez, anchoring the lineup. Rodriguez was 2 for 12 in the series until
adding a single and a homer after the Yankees had fallen far behind. He can
now opt out of his $25.2-million-a-year contract and is expected to seek
untold riches in a new contract.

If he leaves, his last at-bat in pinstripes will be remembered as a harmless
fly ball to right field for the second out in the ninth with the potential
tying run on deck.

Two mainstays from the championship years, Mariano Rivera and Jorge Posada,
can also become free agents. Keeping both, and Rodriguez, will be expensive
but affordable for the Yankees, whose business model thrives despite repeated
playoff failures.

<span class="f3 hl">In his first two at-bats, Rodriguez struck out twice on six pitches against
</span><span class="f3 hl">the soft-tossing Paul Byrd, who fanned no others in five innings. But other
</span><span class="f3 hl">batters were worse in the series — notably Derek Jeter, who hit .176 and
</span><span class="f3 hl">made the first out in the ninth. </span>

<span class="f3 hl">Most damning for the Yankees, though, was the performance of their ace,
</span><span class="f3 hl">Chien-Ming Wang. The major league leader in victories over the past two
</span><span class="f3 hl">seasons, Wang was 0-2 with a 19.06 earned run average against Cleveland.</span>

<span class="f3 hl">In Game 1, Wang matched his career high by allowing eight runs. In Game 4, he
</span><span class="f3 hl">set a career low for innings pitched, with one. Wang gave up two runs in the
</span><span class="f3 hl">first and was charged with two more in the second after leaving with no outs
</span><span class="f3 hl">and the bases loaded.</span> Mike Mussina, who replaced him, allowed two runs in
four and two-thirds innings.

<span class="f3 hl">The decision to start Wang on three days’ rest, for just the second time in
</span><span class="f3 hl">his career, could haunt Torre. He had resisted the urge to do it last fall,
</span><span class="f3 hl">and Jaret Wright lost the elimination game. With Wang another year removed
</span><span class="f3 hl">from his rookie shoulder problems, Torre trusted him.</span>

<span class="f3 hl">He also hoped that, with short rest, Wang might be just tired enough for his
</span><span class="f3 hl">sinkers to fade properly. In Game 1, Wang had been too strong and the pitch
</span><span class="f3 hl">did not sink, causing him to abandon his game plan and throw more sliders and
</span><span class="f3 hl">changeups.</span>

<span class="f3 hl">But the short layoff, and the comfort of pitching at home, did not change
</span><span class="f3 hl">much for Wang. Again, his sinkers were not sinking.</span>

Grady Sizemore led off the game with a home run into the bleachers in
right-center field. Travis Hafner took a sinker to the opposite field for a
one-out single, and he scored when Wang missed with a pitch up in the strike
zone to Jhonny Peralta, who singled to center.

The Yankees wasted a scoring chance in their half of the first, when they put
two runners on with one out for Rodriguez, who whiffed on an 86-mile-an-hour
fastball. Posada then flied out to left fielder Kenny Lofton, who made a
sliding grab.

Lofton was dynamic in the series, and his bunt attempt in Game 3 caused a
lurching Roger Clemens to aggravate his strained hamstring. Lofton’s success
seemed to almost mock Torre, who never wanted Lofton in 2004 and did not get
along with him.

The Yankees signed Lofton that season because Steinbrenner was envious of
Juan Pierre, a speedy leadoff hitter who tormented the Yankees for Florida in
the 2003 World Series. Steinbrenner no longer exerts such direct influence
over player moves, leaving General Manager Brian Cashman to make those calls.

But his public threat to fire Torre if he lost this series, which was
reported Sunday, showed that it was still Steinbrenner’s decision on the
manager. Cashman talked him out of firing Torre after last year’s
first-round loss, but with Torre unsigned for 2008, it is easy now for
Steinbrenner to make a clean break.

“I do respect the fact that he is the boss,” Torre said before Game 4. “It
’s not about how much money he pays me. It’s that he trusted me with his
team, and I take that as a very serious and personal responsibility. And I
hope that I do well enough for him to be proud of what we do.”

The Yankees failed to win the A.L. East this year for the first time in a
decade, but their effort to capture the wild card was a source of pride for
Torre. The Yankees won 73 of their final 112 games to overcome a horrid start
that had put Torre’s job in jeopardy in late April.

It is trendy now to call the postseason a crapshoot, where the unforeseen —
 like a swarm of midges from Lake Erie disrupting Game 2 — can obscure which
team is really best. But Steinbrenner has never believed that, and when Torre
won four titles so quickly, he set an almost impossibly high standard for
himself.

The Yankees’ last pennant was in 2003, when Aaron Boone smashed an
extra-inning homer to cap a stirring comeback against the Red Sox in Game 7
of the A.L. Championship Series. The scoreboard played those highlights
before the bottom of the sixth last night and, as if on cue, Robinson Cano
led off with a homer to chase Byrd.

It cut Cleveland’s lead to 6-2, and during a pitching change, the scoreboard
showed Tino Martinez, sitting by the home dugout, just behind the former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Soon, the crowd was standing and roaring.

But with runners at the corners and one out against Rafael Perez, Jeter
grounded into a double play, ending the inning. The crowd grew silent, then
booed when Kyle Farnsworth came into the game in the seventh.
