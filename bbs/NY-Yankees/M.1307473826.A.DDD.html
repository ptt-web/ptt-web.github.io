The Yankees have stockpiled catching prospects over the past several years,
including Jesus Montero, Gary Sanchez and Austin Romine. The Yankees hope
they&#39;ve added to that haul Tuesday afternoon when they selected Colorado high
school catcher Greg Bird.

Bird, who played at Grandview High School in Aurora, Colorado, wasn&#39;t ranked
among Baseball America&#39;s Top 200 prospects in this year&#39;s draft, but was the
top talent in the state of Colorado.

Here is BA&#39;s profile of Bird for their draft preview:

Greg Bird first put himself on the scouting radar when he was the catcher for
righthander Kevin Gausman, who is now at Louisiana State.

Bird has a 6-foot-4, 205-pound frame and mostly played first base this year,
and that&#39;s where he projects as a pro. There&#39;s obvious strength in his
lefthanded swing.

It can get a little long at times, but he has good bat speed and gets plenty
of loft and backspin on the ball. If he could catch, he would be a much more
attractive prospect, but as a first baseman scouts aren&#39;t quite sold on his
bat, so Bird will likely have to go prove himself at Arkansas.

NEW YORK - Greg Bird was the first Colorado high school player taken in this
year&#39;s Major League Baseball Draft, selected in the fifth round with the
179th overall pick by the New York Yankees on Tuesday.

Bird is coming off an impressive season for the Grandview baseball team, with
a .553 batting average 12 home runs and 38 RBIs.

The senior helped the Wolves become the top seed in the 5A postseason
brackets, before they lost to Highlands Ranch in the second round of the
CHSAA playoffs.

Bird, who is slated to play for the University of Arkansas next season, is
currently playing for Team Vegas in the California Collegiate League. He went
2-for-5 including a triple and RBI in a 12-5 win over the MLB Academy Barons
on Monday in Compton, Calif.
