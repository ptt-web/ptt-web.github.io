A-Rod&#39;s NY exit helps Texas Rangers

10:39 AM CDT on Monday, October 29, 2007

From Staff and Wire Reports

DENVER – Alex Rodriguez has opted out of his contract with the New York
Yankees.

Agent Scott Boras announced the decision during Game 4 of the World Series
on Sunday. By exercising the &#34;opt-out&#34; clause in his contract, Rodriguez
becomes a free agent.

As a result, the Rangers would save about $21 million over the next three
seasons. Under the terms of their deal when they traded Rodriguez to New
York in 2004, the Rangers were to pay the Yankees approximately $7 million
per year through 2010 to subsidize the contract.
Rangers / MLB


&#34;It goes without saying that we&#39;d welcome that news,&#34; general manager Jon
Daniels said. &#34;But until we hear officially, I&#39;m not going to react to
reports.&#34;

Rodriguez originally signed a 10-year deal with the Rangers worth $252
million in December 2000. The contract, however, included an escape clause
that allowed Rodriguez to take free agency after the 2007 season. He had
until 10 days after the end of the World Series to notify the Yankees of
his decision. Rodriguez forfeits the final $72 million in guaranteed
salary.

Boras said during a telephone interview with The Associated Press that
Rodriguez made his choice because he was uncertain whether Mariano Rivera,
Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte would return to the Yankees.

&#34;Alex&#39;s decision was one based on not knowing what his closer, his catcher
and one of his statured pitchers was going to do,&#34; Boras said. &#34;He really
didn&#39;t want to make any decisions until he knew what they were doing.&#34;

Boras said he attempted to notify Yankees general manager Brian Cashman of
the decision Sunday but couldn&#39;t reach him, so he left a voice mail.

&#34;He was traveling, and I was traveling,&#34; Boras said.

The Yankees, who had reportedly been preparing a proposed contract
extension, have said they would not pursue Rodriguez if he opted out. They
lose the Rangers&#39; subsidy if Rodriguez voids his contract.

Boras said the Rangers remain responsible for $3 million in annual
deferred money A-Rod is owed in the next three years under the contract.

The Rangers have asked Major League Baseball to inform them if it receives
official notice of Rodriguez opting out, but on a Sunday night, with every
MLB official at the World Series, it was unlikely the Rangers would hear
from the league.

Rodriguez, likely to win his third AL MVP award next month, made his
decision before the Yankees announced a replacement for departed manager
Joe Torre. Broadcaster Joe Girardi and bench coach Don Mattingly were the
top contenders, and the team also interviewed first-base coach Tony Pena.

Rodriguez hit .314 this year and led the major leagues in home runs and
RBIs.
