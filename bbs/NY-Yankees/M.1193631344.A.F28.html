Press 1 to hear your team was blown up

Scott Boras informed Brian Cashman that Alex Rodriguez was opting out by
leaving him a voice mail.


This came as a surprise. I thought at the very least that Rodriguez would
listen to what the Yankees had to offer. But for Rodriguez make this
decision 10 days earlier than he had to is clear evidence that he never
intended to stay with the Yankees.


In retrospect, one of the reasons he had such a great season was probably
that his mind was clear knowing he would leave New York.

This is what A-Rod said the night the Yankees clinched:

“This feels like home. It’s hard to believe that I played for another two
organizations. So much has happened to me here – adversity, some success –
that I feel like anything but New York feels weird for me now.”

Was he lying? Only he knows. But clearly Rodriguez’s legacy has been
established. The Homeless Hall of Famer will join his third team in six
seasons. He’ll sign a record contract and somewhere in that fine print
will be another option to bail out in a few years.

The Yankees insist that will not pursue Rodriguez as a free agent. Given
how he has treated the team, the Yankees would be embarrassing themselves
to make him an offer.
