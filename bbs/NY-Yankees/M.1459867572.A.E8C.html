Yankees announce preliminary Scranton/Wilkes-Barre roster

Chad Jennings, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="50333a353e3e393e3723103c3f3825347e333f3d">[email&#160;protected]</a> 4:08 p.m. EDT April 4, 2016


The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders have announced their preliminary player
list for the 2016 season. This isn&#39;t necessarily their Opening Day roster,
but it&#39;s close. The Triple-A season starts on Thursday. A few things to
notice about the group the Yankees have assigned to Triple-A at this point:

<span class="f1 hl">Who&#39;s going to fill this rotation?</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Tyler Cloyd </span>and <span class="f2 hl">Chad Green</span> are obviously starting pitchers, but the rest of
this Triple-A pitching staff seems to be made up of 10 relievers. <span class="f2 hl">Kyle </span>
<span class="f2 hl">Haynes</span>,<span class="f2 hl"> Diego Moreno</span> and <span class="f2 hl">Anthony Swarzak</span> have rotation experience, so perhaps
they&#39;ll be stretched out as starters (Haynes in particular makes sense in
that role, and I assume he&#39;ll work as a starter). One interesting possibility
is <span class="f2">Nick Rumbelowm. The Yankees had him starting games in minor league camp </span>
this spring. Last I knew he was stretched out to three innings. Given the
abundance of bullpen options, maybe it makes sense to see if Rumbelow can
make a Chase Whitley-type conversion to the rotation.

<span class="f1 hl">There&#39;s one open spot on the roster</span>
Triple-A rosters used to be limited to 24 players, but several years ago the
limit jumped to 25. This preliminary list has only 24 names, which means
there&#39;s one spot open. That spot could go to a starting pitcher, could go to
another utility man (someone like Dan Fiorito, perhaps), <span class="f2">or I guess it could
</span><span class="f2">go to Jake Cave if and when he&#39;s offered back from the Reds</span>. Worth noting, of
course, that Trenton only has three outfielders currently listed and Cave
would presumably have an easier time getting at-bats if he were sent back to
Double-A. I wouldn&#39;t rule that out.

<span class="f1 hl">Several notable omissions</span>
Double-A Trenton has also announced its preliminary player list for this
season, and there are a few notable names that don&#39;t appear in either
Double-A or Triple-A. Most notable is probably relief pitcher Jacob Lindgren,
who had elbow surgery last season and was among the first players cut from
big league camp this spring. <span class="f2">Brian Cashman said </span><span class="f2 hl">Lindgren</span><span class="f2"> is not hurt,</span> and
Josh Norris is reporting he <span class="f2">may be opening the season in Tampa. Could be</span>
<span class="f2">simply to </span><span class="f6 hl">keep Lindgren out of the cold</span> (they&#39;ve done that before). Also
absent are <span class="f2 hl">Eric Ruth and Jaron Long</span>, a couple of non-drafted free agent
signings who have performed well as Double-A starters. Fiorito and Taylor
Dugas, two very popular players within the organization, are not listed, and
neither is offseason free agent signing Richard Bleier, who I thought would
be in the Triple-A rotation.
