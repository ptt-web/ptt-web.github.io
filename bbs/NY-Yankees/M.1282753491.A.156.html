TORONTO -- On nights like Tuesday, when no pitcher on the other team
can seem to get anyone out and the Rogers Centre is playing more like
the HomerDome, it is easy to overlook the hard facts about what lies
ahead for the Yankees:One reliably good start by CC Sabathia every five
days, followed by the erratic (A.J. Burnett), the limited (Phil Hughes)
and the untested (Dustin Moseley and Ivan Nova).
At some point, Andy Pettitte will come back from the groin injury that
has had him on the disabled list since July 20, although until he throws
a bullpen session Friday, no one knows when that point will be.

<span class="f3 hl">像週二夜晚這樣的比賽，對方的投手似乎無法抓下出局數，Rogers Centre像是個</span>
<span class="f3 hl">全壘打天堂，很容易讓人忽略一些問題。</span>
<span class="f3 hl">每隔五天值得信賴的CC先發投球，然後是不穩定的A.J.，有局數限制的Hughes，</span>
<span class="f3 hl">然後是還沒經過考驗的Moseley和Nova。</span>
<span class="f3 hl">從7月20就待在傷兵名單的Pettitte可能會回到先發，但直到他禮拜五在牛棚練</span>
<span class="f3 hl">投前，沒有人知道他什麼時候會回來。</span>

And if anyone had told you at the start of spring training, or the start
of this month, for that matter, that the Yankees would head into late
August tied in the AL East with the Tampa Bay Rays while relying on a
rotation composed 60 percent of pitchers who had never been full-time
major league starters before this season, you probably would have needed
the Heimlich maneuver as you choked on your New York Yankee Steak.
As no less an authority than Jorge Posada said, even on a night in which
he had four hits, including a home run, &#34;It&#39;s all about the pitching,
really.&#34;
But here we are, in the final week of August, and there they are, the
starting rotation of the defending World Series champions, and how many
of them do you absolutely, completely trust on any given night?

<span class="f3 hl">假如有人在春訓時，或甚至在這個月初告訴你，在八月底的時候洋基有60%的先</span>
<span class="f3 hl">發投手群在今年之前沒有過完整的大聯盟球季，而洋基倚賴這樣的陣容在八月底</span>
<span class="f3 hl">跟光芒並列美東第一，你大概會在吃牛排時嗆到而需要急救。</span>
<span class="f3 hl">現在我們來到八月最後一個禮拜，有多少個投手是你在比賽時會全心信賴的？</span>

Tuesday night, it was easy to trust Moseley, considering the Yankees&#39;
hitters were munching on Blue Jays starter Marc Rzepczynski as if he
were one of the succulent spicy sausages sold outside the ballpark.
Over the first five innings, five of them had hit home runs, even
Derek Jeter, whose last dinger came back when Pettitte still believed
he would be good to go in three weeks. And that one never left the
ballpark.

<span class="f3 hl">週二的比賽，洋基打者狠狠修理藍鳥的先發投手Rzepczynski，前五局就有五個人</span>
<span class="f3 hl">打出全壘打，包括Jeter，他的上一支全壘打得追溯到Pettitte還相信他能在三週</span>
<span class="f3 hl">後回到場上的時候。</span>

The result was completely predictable, considering that three of the
starters in the Yankees&#39; lineup -- Jeter, Robinson Cano and especially
Nick Swisher -- loved hitting off Rzepczynski almost as much as they
love payday.
Jeter came in batting .600 off him (3-for-5 with a HR), Cano .400
(2-for-5 with a 2B and HR) and Swisher a ridiculous .750 (3-for-4
with a HR). By the time Rzepczynski was gone -- after only three
innings -- even Mark Teixeira, who had only one hit off him in five
career at-bats, had improved to .427 with two RBIs and a monstrous
home run, one of three the Yankees hit in the third inning.

<span class="f3 hl">結果完全可以預期，打線中有三個人打Rzepczynski的球打得很好：Jeter、Cano、</span>
<span class="f3 hl">Swisher。Jeter對戰打擊率高達六成（五之三，一支全壘打），Cano四成（五之</span>
<span class="f3 hl">二，二壘安打和全壘打），Swisher是嚇人的七成五（四之三，一支全壘打）。</span>
<span class="f3 hl">即使是之前對上他只擊出一支安打的Teixeira也讓對戰打擊率進步到0.427，兩分</span>
<span class="f3 hl">打點和一支特大號全壘打，讓Rzepczynski只撐了三局。</span>

It was a night in which it was so easy to hit that Swisher, who had
to leave the game in mid-at-bat after fouling a pitch off his left
knee in the seventh, was mock outraged at Brett Gardner, who came in
to replace him with a 2-2 count and promptly went down looking.
&#34;The one time in your life you&#39;ve got a free swing, and you [bleeping]
take?&#34; Swisher said, doing comically incredulous as only he can.

<span class="f3 hl">Swisher在七局時因一個自打球打中左膝而離場，由Gardner替補上場。</span>

So run support was never a problem in this game, because there was
plenty, nor was the effect of pressure on a relatively inexperienced
pitcher, because there was none. The Yankees won a laugher, 11-5,
a game that ceased to be competitive or remotely entertaining after
the fifth inning, when they opened up a 10-1 lead. The only reason it
became that close is because Chad Gaudin, Mop-Up Man, came into the
game in the seventh inning to create some interest.

<span class="f3 hl">所以得分在這場比賽不是問題，對一個不太有經驗的投手也不會有太大壓力。洋</span>
<span class="f3 hl">基贏得很輕鬆，在前五局時是壓倒性的10-1。比數一度接近是因為Gaudin在第</span>
<span class="f3 hl">七局上場後製造一些效果。</span>

But what happens when the games get a little tougher, the opposing
pitchers a little better, the collars a little snugger? Moseley
pitched well enough to win with a nine-run lead, but you have to
wonder if he would have gotten by against the Rays or even the Red Sox
throwing roughly one ball for every strike -- 47 and 50 in his six
innings of work?
&#34;I got behind in a few counts tonight,&#39;&#39; Moseley said. &#34;But getting a
lead like we got tonight makes it a little easier.&#39;&#39;

<span class="f3 hl">但如果比賽更膠著一點會如何？假如對方的投手更好呢？Moseley在有著九分領
</span><span class="f3 hl">先時投得很好，但他在面對光芒或紅襪時的表現會如何？
</span><span class="f3 hl">Moseley說：「像今晚這樣的領先幅度會讓投球更容易。」</span>

And as good as nova looked Monday night -- good enough for Joe Girardi,
Dave Eiland, Brian Cashman and whoever else has his or her fingers in
the Yankees&#39; fortunes this season to exile Javier Vazquez to the bullpen
indefinitely -- he still has just 8 1/3 innings of major league
experience on his résumé.Sure, Nova looked tough against the Blue Jays,
staring down a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the first and standing up to
an agitated Jose Bautista in the sixth, but how will he do in a game
against the Rays, say, in late September with first place on the line?

<span class="f3 hl">Nova週一的先發表現很好，足夠好到讓Vazquez被調去牛棚，但他在大聯盟也只
</span><span class="f3 hl">有8又1/3局的經驗。
</span><span class="f3 hl">當然Nova對藍鳥的表現很好，度過第一局滿壘無人出局的麻煩，又在第六局解
</span><span class="f3 hl">決掉Bautista，但他對上光芒的表現又會如何呢？</span>

These are the questions you&#39;d rather not ponder right now, and questions
the Yankees never could have conceived of when they mapped out their
$200 million roster last winter.
Baseball people like to say you can never have too much pitching and this
season, the Yankees are proving not even they can buy enough.

<span class="f3 hl">洋基在先發輪值上花了200M，但有些問題是他們沒想到的。
</span><span class="f3 hl">棒球人士總愛說投手不嫌多而今年球季，洋基證明他們買得不夠多。</span>

As starting pitchers, the combined records of Hughes, Moseley and Nova
are a respectable 31-20, but 23 of those wins are from Hughes. And the
sum total of postseason experience from the three of them is 13 innings,
12 of them by Hughes, who has an October ERA of 5.25.

<span class="f3 hl">以先發來說，Hughes、Moseley和Nova總共獲得31-20的成績，但其中23勝是來
</span><span class="f3 hl">自Hughes。而他們的季後賽局數是13局，其中12局來自Hughes，但他在10月
</span><span class="f3 hl">的ERA為5.25。</span>

It&#39;s as pointless to ask &#34;How did this happen?&#34; as it is to speculate
about what it will mean if Pettitte doesn&#39;t come back, and strong, in
time for the stretch run.
But suffice it so say that this is not the way the Yankees planned to
defend their title and not the way they would choose to go into the
final rounds of what is shaping up as a championship bout for control
of the division.

<span class="f3 hl">問「會發生什麼事？」就跟猜測萬一Pettitte回不來怎麼辦一樣沒意義。但可以
</span><span class="f3 hl">說這不是洋基尋求衛冕冠軍的方式，也不是爭取分區冠軍的方式。</span>

Staked to a nine-run lead and facing a powerful team with not much
left to play for, Dustin Moseley looked good enough to get the job
done for the Yankees Tuesday night. Chances are, Nova will look the
same against the similarly hopeless Chicago White Sox on Sunday.
But September and October are looming, and the Rays and Red Sox
refuse to go away.
At that point, it will take more than a leap of faith to believe
that the Yankees, who always seem to have too much of everything,
will have enough pitching to see them through.

<span class="f3 hl">Moseley在有九分領先的時候，面對幾乎無法進季後賽但火力旺盛的藍鳥表現得
</span><span class="f3 hl">很好，有很大的機率Nova在週日遇上幾乎沒希望的白襪也會有同樣的表現。
</span><span class="f3 hl">但九月十月就要來了，光芒和紅襪仍然拒絕放棄。
</span><span class="f3 hl">而洋基，一支似乎擁有太多的球隊，希望在那時有足夠的投手跟他們對決。</span>

GAME NOTES: Teixeira&#39;s four-hit game was his first since July 11 at
Seattle. Posada&#39;s was his first since Sept. 3, 2009, right here in
Toronto. And Jeter&#39;s home run was his first since July 22, an inside-
the-park job at Yankee Stadium against Kansas City, a stretch of
128 at-bats. The last time he hit a baseball out of a ballpark was
June 9, when he hit two in the Bronx against the Houston Astros.
That was 250 at-bats ago. ... Swisher left the clubhouse with his
knee tightly bandaged but vowed to come to the park ready to play on
Wednesday. &#34;That first step out of bed tomorrow should be interesting,&#34;
he said. ... Ready for more bad pitching news? Alfredo Aceves, in the
midst of the longest rehab assignment in baseball history, pitched
1 1/3 innings for AA Trenton Tuesday night. He allowed six hits, five
of them doubles, three runs, and struck out no one. ... Gaudin had
his problems again, allowing four hits and three runs in two innings
of work, but Kerry Wood continues to impress, pitching a perfect ninth
with two strikeouts. ... The Yankees kept Bautista, Monday&#39;s hero, in
the ballpark, holding the league&#39;s leading home run hitter to a single
in two official at-bats, plus two walks. ... Marcus Thames and Curtis
Granderson also homered for the Yankees, and aside from being a three-
run bomb, Granderson&#39;s shot was especially impressive because it came
off a lefty, Brian Tallet. ... Wednesday&#39;s pitching
matchup: Hughes (15-5, 3.90) vs. LHP Brett Cecil (10-6, 3.90). First
pitch, 7:07 p.m.

<span class="f3 hl">賽後筆記：鐵爺上一次四安的比賽是7/11在西雅圖，Posada則是2009/9/3在多
</span><span class="f3 hl">倫多，Jeter上一支全壘打是7/22在洋基球場對上皇家時，間隔128個打席。上
</span><span class="f3 hl">一次他把球打到球場外是6/9，對上太空人，250個打席之前了。Swisher發誓他
</span><span class="f3 hl">週三就可以回到球場加入比賽，他說：「明天離開床的第一步應該很有趣，」
</span><span class="f3 hl">（…orz）準備好要聽更多投手的壞消息嗎？Aceves經歷他生涯最長的復健期，
</span><span class="f3 hl">週二晚上在AA投了1又1/3局，被打六支安打，其中五支是二壘安打，丟三分，
</span><span class="f3 hl">沒有任何三振……Gaudin依然老問題，兩局被打四支安打丟三分，但Wood很
</span><span class="f3 hl">棒，完美的第九局。洋基讓週一藍鳥的英雄Bautista，聯盟的全壘打王，兩個打
</span><span class="f3 hl">數只打出一支一壘安打，外加兩個保送……Thames和Granderson也打出全壘
</span><span class="f3 hl">打，尤其是Granderson的三分砲令人印象深刻，那是對左投打出來的….週三的
</span><span class="f3 hl">先發：Hughes vs. LHP Cecil</span>
