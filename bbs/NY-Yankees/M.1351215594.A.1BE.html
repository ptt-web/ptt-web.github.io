Mariano Rivera Thinking Retirement

ESPN New York&#39;s Andrew Marchand discusses the possibility of Mariano Rivera&#39;s
retirement as well as options for the Yankees if he decides not to come
back.Tags: MLB, Yankees, Rivera, Andrew Marchand, Jade McCarthy


New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said closer Mariano Rivera
informed him earlier this week that he is unsure if he will play again or
retire.

Cashman told ESPN New York that on Tuesday he and Rivera had a conversation
in which Rivera said he does not know yet if he will return for a 19th season.

&#34;He wasn&#39;t certain on what he is going to do,&#34; Cashman said.

After he crumbled to the turf and tore his ACL in Kansas City in early May,
Rivera vowed he would return in 2013.


Most Memorable Mo-ments

ESPN New York takes a look back at Mariano Rivera&#39;s greatest saves.

&#34;I&#39;m coming back,&#34; an emotional Rivera said in Kansas City a day after the
injury. &#34;Put it down. Write it down in big letters. I ain&#39;t going down like
this.&#34;

Now, with his 43rd birthday next month and as he&#39;s worked very hard during
his rehab to return, Rivera has the familiar tug that he has carried for many
years of possibly wanting to stay home with his family and call it a career.

In the past, Rivera also has emphasized that he expects to leave the game as
an elite player. If he has doubts that he will retain his skill level, that
also could tilt him to call it a career with the most saves (608) in major
league history and five World Series rings.


The negotiations for a new contract also could be a bit complicated. Rivera
made $15 million last season, but even with the front office&#39;s utmost respect
for him, it is unclear what it will offer him considering he would be
returning after a season in which he pitched in only nine games.

The 50 Greatest Yankees

Choosing the 50 Greatest Yankees was a daunting task. ESPNNewYork.com rose to
the challenge. Top 50  Rank &#39;Em

This offseason, the Yankees are beginning to tighten their budget in
anticipation of trying to lower payroll by 10 percent to $189 million for
2014. Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner has mandated the plan to take advantage
of the new luxury tax breaks.

During his end-of-season news conference Wednesday, Yankees manager Joe
Girardi hinted that Rivera may not return.

&#34;From watching how he rehabbed and everything that he was going through,
picked up a baseball sooner than he was supposed to and got his hand smacked
a little bit, that would tell me that Mo probably wants to play,&#34; Girardi
said. &#34;But in saying that, it&#39;s a decision that I think he&#39;ll sit down with
his family, evaluate where he is maybe a little bit later in this process and
how he feels and how his arm feels, to feel like you think you can compete at
the same level he&#39;s always competed at. But I don&#39;t think that you push a
rehab like he pushed it unless you think that you possibly have some interest
in coming back.&#34;

Since Rivera already had vowed to come back last May, Girardi&#39;s words were
taken as managerial-speak, the feeling being Girardi did not want to commit
to a player who wasn&#39;t signed yet.

In Rivera&#39;s place this season, Rafael Soriano thrived as the Yankees&#39; closer,
converting 42-of-46 save chances. Soriano could opt out of the final season
of his contract. Soriano&#39;s agent, Scott Boras, hinted that Soriano would
choose free agency but said a final decision had not been made.

&#34;He&#39;s one of the best closers in baseball,&#34; Boras said. &#34;He had 42 saves, and
he didn&#39;t start until May.&#34;

Rivera has been cryptic about his plans to play or retire. During spring
training, he said that he knew whether 2012 would be his last season, but he
declined to tell anyone in the front office or the media.

After the injury, Rivera said he would come back for 2013. Now it is still
probable, but suddenly it is not certain.
