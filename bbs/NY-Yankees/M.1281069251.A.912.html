Is it just me, or was this a slower off day than usual? The trade deadline
has come and gone, Alex Rodriguez has his 600th home run, everyone is well
aware of where the Yankees sit in the standings and a Red Sox-Yankees series
needs no additional hype. It’s been a quiet day, in a good way.

Is it just me, or was this a slower off day than usual? The trade deadline
has come and gone, Alex Rodriguez has his 600th home run, everyone is well
aware of where the Yankees sit in the standings and a Red Sox-Yankees series
needs no additional hype. It’s been a quiet day, in a good way.

Not such a quiet day for the Red Sox

Kevin Youkilis is out for the year. The team announced that Youkilis will
have surgery to repair his thumb tomorrow. He’s expected to be back in time
for spring training. The news came one day after Jacoby Ellsbury was
activated from the disabled list, and three days after Mike Cameron was
placed back on the DL with a lower abdominal strain
Without Youkilis, Cameron or Dustin Pedroia, here’s the lineup Boston is
using the night before coming to the Bronx: Ellsbury CF, Scutaro SS, Ortiz
DH, Martinez C, Drew RF, Beltre 3B, Lowell 1B, Kalish LF, Hall 2B. The
Yankees could see something similar this weekend

Some other notes

‧ Tim Redding, who had been arguably Scranton/Wilkes-Barre’s best starting
pitcher, has accepted a contract offer to play in Korea. I’m not sure he had
pitched his way past Ivan Nova for a call-up, but he had a 0.69 WHIP during
the month of July. That’s insane. Just like Donnie Collins predicted, Kei
Igawa was moved into the rotation to fill Redding’s spot. Also, Amaury Sanit
is back from his suspension.

‧ Speaking of guys who used to play for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre: Cody Ransom
has been designated for assignment by the Phillies and Chad Tracy has signed
with the Marlins.

‧ The Royals have designated Jose Guillen. He’s a right-handed hitting
outfielder, but if the Yankees had any interest, I imagine they easily could
have traded for him instead of Austin Kearns.

‧ Adam Dunn has been claimed off waivers. Jon Paul Morosi writes that the
claiming team is unknown, but I find it hard to believe he could have slipped
all the way to the Yankees.

‧ Someone finally owns the Texas Rangers, and it’s not Mark Cuban.

‧ When rounded — like it will be in every statistical listing ever —
 Mariano Rivera now has a 1.00 career WHIP. Russell Kahn marvels at that
number over at Mr. Blogtober. … By the way, Russell calls that post the
first of a 954-part series. If I ever claim to have a 954-part series in the
works, feel free to smack me right in the head
