The Yankees Explain Their Fiscal Austerity
By DAVID WALDSTEIN
Published: March 2, 2012

TAMPA, Fla. — On Thursday, Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees’ managing general
partner, declared that the Yankees would cut roughly $20 million from their
payroll over the next two years. That would get them under baseball’s $189
million luxury-tax threshold, which serves as a kind of soft salary cap.

On Friday, General Manager Brian Cashman explained the challenges of
following that plan while remaining a contender. Although some of the team’s
fans might be concerned that the Yankees’ inherent financial advantage will
be eliminated by the guidelines established in baseball’s new collective
bargaining agreement, Cashman promised that the Yankees will still have
significant monetary resources, even if Steinbrenner is more of a fiscal
conservative than his father was.

“We’re still the Yankees,” Cashman said. “We’re still going to outspend
everybody else. That’s not going to change. We’re still going to be there
for our fan base, and try to make sure that every year is a year that they
have legitimate hope that this could be a special season. That’s never going
to change.”

But Cashman noted that, in some areas, the presence of a fiscal barrier will
make his job easier. In the past, when the Yankees spent lavishly to get
marquee free agents or to re-sign their own stars, it was hard for Cashman to
tell an agent that the team didn’t have more to spend on his player.

The agents would usually continue to ask for more money. When George
Steinbrenner owned the team, they might try to get him on the phone. But now
that Hal Steinbrenner has mandated that the Yankees’ payroll will not exceed
$189 million by 2014, Cashman has a weapon as he negotiates long-term deals.

“It was very difficult when it was just open-ended,” Cashman said. “It
would change on a daily basis. ‘Don’t lose the player, at all costs.’ That
’s not a good negotiating position to be in, and if it’s very vocal at the
same time? If it’s public and private, you’re basically in the position of
getting rolled.”

Cashman agreed with Steinbrenner that the Yankees’ payroll, which stands at
about $210 million, is too high. He pointed to other American League teams
that have found consistent success without staggering payrolls.

“Our payroll doesn’t need to be at this level,” Cashman said. “It’s at a
certain level because of massive commitments that we’ve already made, I
think most of which have been very functional and good investments, and have
been thus far. But at the same time, look at the Minnesota Twins, look at the
Tampa Bay Rays, look at a lot of clubs that are having massive success going
about it a different way.”

The big financial issues facing the Yankees over the next few years are
re-signing Robinson Cano while also signing Russell Martin and Nick Swisher,
who can be free agents after this season, and also Curtis Granderson, who can
be a free agent after 2013.

Cashman would not discuss any specifics about addressing those concerns, or
even whether it was possible to sign all those players under the new
financial limitations. But it is clear that the Yankees’ long-term planning
for contracts will be done with that $189 million figure at the forefront of
their thinking.

“Obviously we love what Robinson Cano does for us, we love what Curtis
Granderson does for us,” Cashman said. “We gravitate to players that we
feel can be champions and take us to the next level. I think we have a
collection of those guys, and we have some young guys coming.”

For Manager Joe Girardi, who managed the 2006 Florida Marlins with a payroll
that was $1,500 shy of $15 million, there are no complaints about a $189
million payroll.

“It’s not like that number is a low number,” Girardi said. “What manager
wouldn’t want a number like that?”
