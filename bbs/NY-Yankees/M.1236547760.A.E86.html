Rodriguez to Have Hip Surgery on Monday

Published: March 8, 2009

TAMPA, Fla. — Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees will undergo surgery Monday in
Vail, Colo., to repair part of the damage in his right hip and will miss six
to nine weeks of play, his doctor and the team announced on Sunday.

The procedure will correct a torn labrum and will address some of the
underlying bone irregularity in the hip, Dr. Marc Philippon said in a
conference call, but Rodriguez will probably need more extensive surgery
after the season.

Under the best-case scenario, that would mean that Rodriguez could return to
the Yankees by early May and miss about a month of the six-month season.

The option chosen on Sunday is the middle alternative that was discussed over
the weekend by Rodriguez, the team and the doctor. At first, the Yankees and
Rodriguez hoped he could start the season following the draining last week of
a cyst caused by a torn labrum.

But that option quickly was dismissed. The most aggressive correction would
have been to undergo more extensive surgery to correct the underlying cause
of the problem, but that likely would have kept Rodriguez idle for 12 to 16
weeks, Dr. Philippon said.

Rodriguez will remain in Vail for rehabilitation, Dr. Philippon said, and
there is a good chance that he could play much of the 2009 season without
further problems.

“We’re trying to return him rapidly to his high-level function,” Dr.
Philippon said. “I firmly believe this approach will be successful.”

Rodriguez, a slugging third baseman, is considered one of baseball’s best
hitters and is one of the sport’s most controversial players. Last month,
Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing substances from 2001 to
2003 when he played for Texas.

Those substances were not believed to be the cause of his current condition.
Rodriguez had planned to play for the Dominican Republic in the World
Baseball Classic but left that training camp last week to be examined for his
hip discomfort.

Brian Cashman, the general manager of the Yankees, said Sunday’s decision
was “not only a legitimate option but the best option.” Rodriguez was not
available for comment.

Dr. Philippon said he was “almost 100 percent sure” that Rodriguez will
need another surgery after the season.
