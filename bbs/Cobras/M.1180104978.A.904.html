他前陣子接受獨聯記者訪問的內容：

King of the Hill: Clearly, the headline department was working overtime on
that one.

Anyway, I spoke to Newark Bears P Jeremy Hill Thursday morning to get his
thoughts on joining the starting rotation.

The 29-year-old was drafted by the Royals in 1996 as a catcher, but was
converted to a pitcher following the 2000 season.

He made it to the big leagues just one year later with Kansas City, and split
2003 between the Royals and Triple-A Omaha, where he made his first and up
until last Saturday, only career start.

With Hill having left after five hitless innings against the Bluefish that
day, it seems like he may have a future in taking the ball every fifth day.

&#34;I was in spring this year with the Dodgers, and I got extended a few times
there,&#34; Hill said. &#34;I threw the ball well, and I felt like I could go a few
extra innings.&#34;

&#34;I figured I&#39;d give it a try. It&#39;s something else for my resume, maybe for
something else down the line.&#34;

After putting together a 2006 season where he was easily the Bears best
pitcher, the Dallas native was picked up by the Dodgers and brought to Spring
Training. Still with an excellent chance to get picked up again, he believes
you won&#39;t see him in the first inning if it does happen.

&#34;I think ultimately I&#39;ll be used as a bullpen pitcher,&#34; he said. &#34;With the
way I pitch, I&#39;m pretty much a max effort guy, that and I have two pitches.
In an organization, I think I&#39;d be a bullpen pitcher.&#34;

So will being used as a starter hurt his chances of getting picked up?

&#34;I feel like being a starter gets you more exposure,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#39;re out
there for more innings, and it&#39;s a chance for more eyes to see you.&#34;

While being a starter has treated him well, coming out of the bullpen has its
advantages as well.

&#34;Sure, I miss it,&#34; he said. &#34;The adrenaline rush of being a reliever is
great, and I feel more comfortable coming out of the pen right now, but I
think after a few starts, that comfort level will get there as well.&#34;
