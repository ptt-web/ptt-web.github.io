<span class="f2">※ 引述《LAscum (洛城痞子)》之銘言：
</span><span class="f6">: Bonds&#39; streak ends in SF loss
</span><span class="f6">: By Rich Draper / MLB.com
</span><span class="f6">: SAN FRANCISCO -- The Giants felt all along that the National League West could
</span><span class="f6">: be a tougher division this season, but they never envisioned themselves being
</span><span class="f6">: near the bottom of the standings early on.
</span><span class="f6">: That&#39;s the case, however, as San Francisco suffered its sixth loss in the last
</span><span class="f6">: seven games with an 11-0 blanking by the second-place San Diego Padres (8-7) at
</span><span class="f6">:  SBC Park on Wednesday night and remained in fourth place with a 6-9 record.
</span><span class="f6">: Slugger Barry Bonds&#39; glorious streak -- eight homers in seven straight games --
</span><span class="f6">:  ended quietly, as he struck out looking, walked twice and never even managed a
</span><span class="f6">:  swing.
</span>BB爺今天在第二局面對Jake Peavy 結果called strike out
接著另兩打席都保送上壘
整場3打席都沒揮棒......沒好球&gt;&#34;&lt;
也終止了連7場全壘打...可惜了
<span class="f6">: In two games, Bonds has seen 29 pitches and only swung at one, cracking a
</span><span class="f6">: two-run homer against the Padres on Tuesday night.
</span><span class="f6">: If the defending division champion Giants feel a bit shocked at these early
</span><span class="f6">: developments, you can&#39;t blame them.
</span>兩場比賽  面對29球只揮棒1次..Home run!!
絕對是史上  HR/Swing 最高的..
Bonds每揮一棒..對方投手就會心驚膽跳..
<span class="f6">: So uncharacteristic. So unfathomable. So unreal.
</span><span class="f6">: Making matters worse, ace hurler Jason Schmidt -- last season&#39;s National League
</span><span class="f6">:  Cy Young Award runner-up -- was at a loss why he gave up six earned runs on
</span><span class="f6">: seven hits and three wild pitches over only four innings in his second game of
</span><span class="f6">: the season.
</span><span class="f6">: That&#39;s not him, just like it&#39;s not the Giants, scuffling for runs and getting
</span><span class="f6">: shut out twice so far.
</span><span class="f6">: &#34;Physically I feel really good, but I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on,&#34; said Schmidt
</span><span class="f6">: , now 0-2. &#34;I don&#39;t feel like myself and I&#39;m having a hard time throwing the
</span><span class="f6">: ball down in the zone. You&#39;d think things would just click. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m
</span><span class="f6">: that far off, I just have to figure out what it is.
</span><span class="f6">: &#34;I wanted to come out and give the team a lift tonight and tried to press a
</span><span class="f6">: little hard to do it. Everything feels flat. No excuses, you still have to make
</span><span class="f6">:  your pitches.&#34;
</span>Jason Schmidt 被打爆...最近巨人就不常贏了..想不到陣中王牌投手都<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="456b6b6b6b05">[email&#160;protected]</a>@||
今年巨人....不妙...
恐怕Bonds又要當悲劇英雄...
<span class="f6">: Schmidt, who suffered shoulder soreness in the spring to delay his first outing
</span><span class="f6">:  until last Friday, used the dreaded &#34;S&#34; word -- for slump -- in analyzing
</span><span class="f6">: what&#39;s happening with the Giants as a whole.
</span><span class="f6">: Getting only four hits against the Padres wasn&#39;t pretty, while watching San
</span><span class="f6">: Diego collect 17 hits Wednesday and 15 the night before -- whew.
</span><span class="f6">: &#34;I&#39;m flat, the whole team is flat,&#34; said the 31-year-old veteran. &#34;Teams do go
</span><span class="f6">: through slumps. We&#39;re stale right now and need a sparkplug. I take pride in
</span><span class="f6">: trying to do that, but hopefully Woody [Kirk Rueter] can be the sparkplug
</span><span class="f6">: tomorrow and get things going.&#34;
</span><span class="f6">: Manager Felipe Alou said Bonds was unhappy that his chances of getting a real
</span><span class="f6">: at-bat and tying the Major League record of hitting homers in eight consecutive
</span><span class="f6">:  games were slim, with the Padres intent on walking him semi-purposefully.
</span><span class="f6">: So Alou took Bonds out after the seventh.
</span><span class="f6">: &#34;He was kind of disappointed,&#34; said Alou. &#34;The chances of him being walked
</span><span class="f6">: again -- we don&#39;t know the percentage. I wanted to take him out an inning
</span><span class="f6">: before, but he played defense then the score got out of hand.&#34;
</span><span class="f6">: Winning pitcher Jake Peavy (1-1), who shut out San Francisco over seven innings
</span><span class="f6">:  on April 11 at PETCO Park, again kept the Giants off stride with a mix of
</span><span class="f6">: sliders and changeups, holding them scoreless through six innings.
</span><span class="f6">: Mark Loretta had a three-run homer in the fourth, while Brian Giles homered
</span><span class="f6">: in the seventh and drove in two more runs in the eighth with a single.
</span><span class="f6">: Left-handed reliever Noah Lowry, called up from Triple-A Fresno before the game
</span><span class="f6">:  for emergency purposes and to protect a beleaguered bullpen, gave up nine hits
</span><span class="f6">:  and four runs over three innings.
</span><span class="f6">: Lowry was sent down to Fresno after the game, but he did save the pen. Reliever
</span><span class="f6">:  Scott Eyre, out since the start of the season with back pain, was recalled
</span><span class="f6">: from his rehab assignment at Fresno.
</span><span class="f6">: The trick now is to lift the Giants out of their doldrums, and soon.
</span><span class="f6">: &#34;I don&#39;t get frustrated,&#34; said Alou. &#34;We want to win games. You&#39;ve got to be
</span><span class="f6">: realistic as to why we&#39;re not winning. We still don&#39;t have it together yet.
</span><span class="f6">: &#34;I look at the reasons why. We&#39;re not hitting a lot, we&#39;re not getting a lot of
</span><span class="f6">:  innings from the starting pitchers and we have a bullpen that is tired. We&#39;ve
</span><span class="f6">: been behind 6-0 and 7-0 the last two games and there&#39;s not much you can do to
</span><span class="f6">: get out of an early hole.&#34;
