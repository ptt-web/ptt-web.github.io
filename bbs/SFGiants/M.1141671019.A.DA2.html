SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Giants pitcher Matt Morris is famous for being intense on
 the mound -- &#34;like an 18-year-old kid, revved up and trying to get outs,&#34; he
joked -- but in Sunday&#39;s initial spring outing there were no mental fireworks.
He did issue three runs and two walks in San Francisco&#39;s 9-7 loss to Team USA
at Scottsdale Stadium, yet was happy with his debut, the weather, his arm and,
 as a plus, opposing the World Baseball Classic squad.

&#34;It went well,&#34; he said of his 2 1/3-inning effort. &#34;I was excited to get out
there and make some good pitches, and I enjoy the competition -- there&#39;s no
better measure of how good you are than against those guys.&#34;

Morris admittedly got fatigued in the third inning, resulting in a too-high
fastball and getting behind in the count. No problem, however, for the club&#39;s
No. 2 hurler is just getting warm.

Just wait, though, he says. Wait until the pressure&#39;s on and his coolness
begins to sizzle.

&#34;I can be intense and be a maniac out there, so I have to control it, use the
energy to my advantage,&#34; said Morris.

Giants manager Felipe Alou felt the right-hander did well, pitching
aggressively from the outset, before tiring, and wasted little time between
pitches.

&#34;I think he&#39;s throwing with confidence and feels comfortable on the mound,&#34;
said Alou. &#34;And the way he pitches [quickly] you want to play defense behind
him.&#34;

Sadler&#39;s debut: Nothing like being Giants farmhand Billy Sadler, 24, in his
first Spring Training contest and facing, in order -- with the bases loaded
-- Derek Jeter, Ken Griffey Jr., Mark Teixiera and Chipper Jones of Team USA.

&#34;Honestly, I was talking to some of the guys on the team and said I&#39;d love to
face Derek Jeter -- man, this is awesome coming in with the bases loaded. I
was so excited. He&#39;s the man.&#34;

Unfortunately for the Pensacola, Fla., native, the right-handed reliever gave
up three runs (none earned) after an error by Ray Durham. The big blow was
Jones&#39; two-run homer to right-center.

&#34;It was everything mixed,&#34; said Sadler of his stint. &#34;Nervous, zone, trying to
 stay focused. [Catcher Mike] Matheny and Rags [pitching coach Dave Righetti]
both told me to &#39;just play some catch, kid.&#39; &#34;

The good thing for Sadler is it&#39;s over now, that initial Major League test,
just like his first farm outing.

&#34;In that game I gave up everything you can give up in a game -- a single,
double, triple and home run.&#34;

Winn excited: The best part, at least initially, of being a member of the
World Baseball Classic&#39;s Team USA is getting to know his teammates on a
personal level, said Giants outfielder Randy Winn.

&#34;You have an idea of what people are like, but until you spend some time
around them it&#39;s different -- that&#39;s been the fun part,&#34; said Winn, who batted
 eighth in the exhibition contest.

What about talkative Dontrelle Willis?

&#34;Even more so -- and it&#39;s genuine,&#34; said Winn. &#34;He&#39;s always laughing, telling
stories. He&#39;s pretty funny.&#34;

Winn says Team USA is going all-out to assist the players, with Rick Sutcliffe
 throwing breaking balls, with coaches always available for extra hitting,
throwing, whatever.

&#34;We want to come here and win, but they also realize our jobs are to get ready
 for the regular season,&#34; said Winn, adding the whole Classic experience has
yet to sink in.

&#34;Up to this point, we&#39;ve just been a group of guys working out together,&#34; he
said.

Mays holds court: Giants Hall of Famer Willie Mays was asked if he would have
played on Team USA during his career.

&#34;You kidding?&#34; he replied, explaining what a super squad that would have been.
 &#34;I would have had to bat leadoff,&#34; he said.

USA players, including Yankee Jeter, were anxious to talk baseball with Mays,
who said that early American team would have blown away the competition,
especially with the likes of Bob Gibson and Sandy Koufax on the hill.

Former national team players: Sunday&#39;s starting pitcher Morris along with
Barry Bonds and Steve Finley are current Giants who have previously played on
a USA national squad.

Morris played for the USA collegiate team in 1994, while Bonds played for the
1984 World Cup team when playing for Arizona State, and Finley was a member of
 the 1986 USA Baseball national team (collegiate).

Coming up: The Giants host the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim at 12:05 p.m. PT
on Monday at Scottsdale Stadium, with left-hander Noah Lowry (0-0, 16.20 ERA)
the starter. The squads will have a designated hitter, but Alou said there is
&#34;no chance&#34; that Bonds will see action.

Finley, Durham and Matheny aren&#39;t expected to play.
