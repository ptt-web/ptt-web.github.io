SAN FRANCISCO -- The record only lasted about 23 hours.
In his first at-bat since setting Major League Baseball&#39;s all-time homer mark
Tuesday night, Giants slugger Barry Bonds one-upped himself Wednesday and
began to create some distance from Hank Aaron.

Bonds hit his 757th homer, a two-run shot and 23rd of the season, into McCovey
 Cove. The 438-foot &#34;Splash Hit&#34; over the right-field fence wall off Nationals
 right-hander Tim Redding was his 35th to reach the cove since AT&amp;T Park
opened in 2000 and second of the season. The Giants have hit 45 to the water
as a team.

Redding was the 447th pitcher to allow at least one homer to Bonds in his
22-year career, the last 15 with the Giants.

It was the first time Bonds has hit homers in successive at-bats since April
13 at Pittsburgh, during his first of two two-homer games this season. He now
has three homers in his last four starts, dating back to Saturday night&#39;s
record-tying shot in San Diego. Through the first inning Wednesday, he had
pounded out four consecutive hits -- a double, single and the two homers --
over the course of the last two games.

Bonds eclipsed Aaron&#39;s 33-year record of 755 in the fifth inning Tuesday night
 with his 435-foot homer into the bleachers just right of dead center off
Washington left-hander Mike Bacsik.
