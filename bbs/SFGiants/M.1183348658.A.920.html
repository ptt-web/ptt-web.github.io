Big bats back dominant Lincecum
Rookie fans career-high 12; Bonds gets 2,900th career hit

Tim Lincecum paired his career-high 12 strikeouts with an impressive zero
walks. (Ben Margot/AP)



SAN FRANCISCO -- There were a lot of zeros in Sunday&#39;s game, mostly under the
Diamondbacks&#39; run column, but the biggest zero of all for starting pitcher Tim
 Lincecum was the one next to the number of walks issued.
&#34;I&#39;ve been struggling a lot lately, and it&#39;s good to see a nice zero up there,
&#34; Lincecum said.

The Giants took batting practice against Arizona&#39;s pitching staff Sunday and
clinched the series with a 13-0 win over the Diamondbacks and a pitching
performance of sheer excellence from Lincecum. The funny thing is Lincecum
wasn&#39;t even supposed to start Sunday. He was almost scrapped after four bad
outings, but he demonstrated a return in his command in his last start against
 the Padres. In case there were any lingering doubts, he gave a second
demonstration Sunday.

&#34;I didn&#39;t throw as many curveballs as I would like to, but I had my changeup
going and I was throwing strikes with my fastball,&#34; Lincecum said.

Was he ever. Lincecum was most pleased with that big doughnut under walks, but
 next to that was the even more impressive number of 12 strikeouts. Lincecum
struck out nine of the first 14 batters he faced and shut out the Diamondbacks
 for seven innings, for his third shutout performance of the season. He struck
 out at least two batters every inning until the fifth and the 12 strikeouts
he came away with were a Giants season high as well as a personal career high.

First baseman Ryan Klesko had a front-row view for Lincecum&#39;s strikeout
 barrage.

&#34;He was spotting his fastball and his breaking ball, too. When he&#39;s got both
those working, he&#39;s going to get some tough outs,&#34; Klesko said.

With Lincecum&#39;s full arsenal in effect, there wasn&#39;t much the Diamondbacks
could do other than barely manage three hits.

Klesko turned out to be a big difference-maker, too. Like Lincecum, he almost
didn&#39;t make the Sunday lineup after he strained his abdomen Saturday, but not
only was he able to play, he was one triple away from hitting for the cycle
and provided four RBIs.

Klesko gave the Giants their first lead in the fourth inning with a towering
home run into the right-field arcade seats, on the heels of a splash-hit
homer he launched Friday. He was also part of a six-run fifth inning that
Barry Bonds busted open.

It was a big afternoon for Bonds, and not just because he made the All-Star
lineup as a starter. Bonds lined career hit 2,900, a double down the right-
field line that knocked in two runs and gave him sole possession over Willie
Mays of the San Francisco doubles record, with 377.

Bengie Molina followed up in the same inning with a three-run homer that he
blasted into the left-field bleachers, cementing the Giants&#39; win.

Amid all the happiness and home runs, there was one disappointed player. After
 the game, outfielder Nate Schierholtz was optioned back to Fresno to make
room for Rich Aurilia, who&#39;s expected to rejoin the team Tuesday.
