SAN FRANCISCO -- Barry Bonds&#39; reaction to Commissioner Bud Selig&#39;s
authorization of an investigation into past use of performance-enhancing drugs
 in Major League Baseball started with a smile, then a joking reiteration of
his intentions.
&#34;I&#39;m going to jump off the Empire State Building,&#34; Bonds said to reporters at
AT&amp;T Park on Thursday night as he sat in his clubhouse chair. &#34;Flat on my
face.&#34;

Asked to comment about the investigation, the outfielder replied, &#34;No comment,
&#34; then shook his head and said, &#34;No, no, no&#34; when the question was repeated.

The Giants issued a statement earlier on Thursday, declaring, &#34;As we have said
 all along, the Giants support the Commissioner&#39;s decision to review all
aspects of what is obviously a serious matter. We commend the selection of
George Mitchell to head up this investigation and we pledge our full support
to the Commissioner, Senator Mitchell and his team.&#34;

Several Giants have spoken out in support of Bonds this spring, with veteran
center fielder Steve Finley especially becoming close to the slugger. The two
have talked frequently about playing the outfield and are now good friends.

Earlier in camp, Finley said that the team has &#34;embraced&#34; Bonds and wouldn&#39;t
make negative comments about him. On Thursday he took exception to the timing
of the Commissioner&#39;s office investigation and the release of &#34;Game of Shadows
,&#34; a book alleging that Bonds and several other athletes used performance-
enhancing drugs.

&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right -- you didn&#39;t hear anything about this until the
book came out,&#34; said Finley, also miffed that the book&#39;s publication, on March
 23, came during the World Baseball Classic and shortly before Opening Day.

&#34;There&#39;s nothing players can do about it,&#34; he said of the probe. &#34;It is what
it is. What&#39;s new? There&#39;s nothing in [the book] that anyone in baseball or in
 the media that reads the newspapers didn&#39;t already know.&#34;

Finley said that he can look in the mirror with a clear conscience regarding
performance-enhancing drugs, stating that he never saw players take anything
illegal, and only heard rumors.

&#34;I never took anything,&#34; he said. &#34;In this country, people are presumed
innocent until proven guilty. I think the stats will start to prove the game
is cleaned up. I don&#39;t think anybody wants to see suspensions. Baseball is
going to move on.&#34;

Second baseman Ray Durham said that he has been impressed with Bonds&#39;
demeanor during the spring despite the controversy swirling about him.

&#34;I told him probably 2 1/2 weeks ago I was impressed,&#34; Durham said. &#34;You&#39;ve
got to have tough skin to put up with the scrutiny and stuff he has to go
through. I would have been ready to fight somebody. Trying to drag his name
through the mud is unfair to a guy.&#34;

Though Bonds would not comment on the investigation, all baseball-related
questions were fair game, and he reported that the mild strain of his left
elbow was &#34;OK&#34; before playing against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as a
designated hitter in a Spring Training game at AT&amp;T Park.

Bonds hadn&#39;t seen action since March 24 in Scottsdale, Ariz., when he played
seven innings in the Giants&#39; 6-4 victory over Colorado. The next day he pulled
 out of batting practice because of the elbow injury.

Giants&#39; fans were certainly in Bonds&#39; corner on Thursday night at cold and
windy AT&amp;T Park, giving him a standing ovation before he flied out in his
first at-bat, in the second inning.

Bonds walked in the fourth frame and was then taken out of the game.

&#34;He had two at-bats and saw some pitches,&#34; said manager Felipe Alou. &#34;It was
not enough, but better than nothing. Maybe he&#39;ll get four at-bats in one of
the [weekend] games. But it&#39;s still better than last year -- no at-bats.&#34;
