LOS ANGELES -- Don&#39;t expect the Giants to come home with their tails between
their legs. No sir. It&#39;s wagging ... furiously ... hopefully.
Sure, they&#39;re having their problems, and losing 9-0 to the rival Los Angeles
Dodgers on Sunday and suffering their ninth loss in the past 11 games is
disturbing if not yet a trend.

It&#39;s April, only April, and you can bet they&#39;re eager to see the month and its
so-so record end.

But while they&#39;re not happy with a 7-12 record and falling into the National
League West Division cellar for the second time this season -- before this year
, they were last there April 30, 2000 -- the one emotion they won&#39;t show is
frustration.

&#34;If you&#39;re frustrated as a team, you show a sign of weakness and defeat,&#34; said
outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds as the Giants prepare for a three-game series at
SBC Park starting Monday against the Atlanta Braves.

&#34;You can be disappointed at yourself for a poor at-bat, but you have to be
mentally focused for the next game because you always have another chance,&#34;
said Hammonds, who was robbed of extra bases on a 395-foot blast to center in
the ninth Sunday by Dave Roberts&#39; leaping grab at the wall.

&#34;But if you&#39;re always thinking about losing day after day and think, &#39;Here we
go again,&#39; then you&#39;re already beat,&#34; said Hammonds.

Still, opposing the Braves and then the defending world champion Florida
Marlins could be a bit intimidating to say the least, especially after Sunday&#39;s
 ugly defeat at Dodger Stadium.

It was a homerfest, with Los Angeles&#39; Milton Bradley cracking a pair of home
runs, Alex Cora hitting a three-run shot and Cesar Izturis contributing a homer
 preceding Bradley&#39;s first blast in the third inning.

Dodgers left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii (3-1) blanked the Giants on a four-hitter,
while San Francisco&#39;s fill-in starter Brian Cooper -- slated pitcher Dustin
Hermanson was scratched with lower back pain -- yielded five hits and six runs
over only three innings.

&#34;We&#39;ve got to get going and win at home,&#34; said manager Felipe Alou. &#34;We&#39;ve had
tough time at times and it&#39;s been a lot of little things, and we&#39;ve been losing
 at home.&#34;

Cooper said he made a mistake pitch to Cora in the second inning, trying to
throw a slider on the inside to sneak it by him, even shaking off catcher
Yorvit Torrealba&#39;s throw-it-outside suggestion.

&#34;If you stay away from him, the most you&#39;re going to do is get a single to left
 or a fly ball, but I got a little selfish,&#34; said Cooper, who learned he would
pitch around 10:30 a.m. and had little time to prepare.

&#34;That&#39;s my job, and whether or not I get the ball in the first inning or the
15th I have to be ready to pitch -- and I was,&#34; said the right-hander. &#34;I had
a lot of confidence and good stuff, but that&#39;s just the way it goes sometimes.&#34;

Rookie Kevin Correia, specifically brought up from Triple-A Fresno on Friday
for emergency purposes, gave up an RBI single to Shawn Green in the fourth and
Bradley&#39;s second solo shot in the sixth.

Correia will probably be sent back to Fresno on Monday, with an infielder
expected to bolster the roster. There could be several moves, for Hermanson is
almost resigned to be on the 15-day disabled list.

&#34;When you have trouble taking off your socks, it&#39;s hard to get Major League
hitters out,&#34; said Hermanson. &#34;It&#39;s pretty disappointing. I worked pretty hard
to get ready and this happens.

&#34;The DL? I can understand that because in two days from now I&#39;ll have to pitch
a bullpen, and if I can&#39;t do that, how can I pitch the next game? I have to do
whatever is best for the team. I don&#39;t want to be on the DL, but it&#39;s something
 you can&#39;t control.&#34;

Giants outfielder Barry Bonds had two at-bats, popping out and singling. His
Major League-leading batting average stands at .512 and his on-base percentage
at .700.

Bonds has 667 career homers and nine this season, but he hasn&#39;t homered since
April 20 vs. San Diego at SBC Park. His next smash will give him and late
father Bobby Bonds a combined 1,000 homers, already the best all-time for a
father-son combination.
