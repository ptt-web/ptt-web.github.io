Lewis gets two singles, double, triple, homer vs. Rockies.

DENVER -- Upon Fred Lewis&#39; recall from Triple-A Fresno last Thursday,
San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy discussed his eagerness to see
the 26-year-old outfielder develop.&#34;I think he has a chance to be a special
player,&#34; Bochy said. &#34;He has all the tools.&#34;

Lewis developed quickly on Sunday. Playing only his 16th Major League game
and starting just his fourth game with the Giants, the left-handed-batting
Lewis hit for the cycle while helping the Giants roar to a 15-1 lead over
the Colorado Rockies.

Batting leadoff and playing center field, Lewis doubled in the first inning
and lofted a three-run homer in the fourth off Colorado starter
Taylor Buchholz. It was Lewis&#39; first Major League home run. Defying
the percentages, Lewis drove an RBI triple to left-center field in the
fifth inning off Rockies left-hander Tom Martin. Lewis finished his cycle
in the seventh inning when he led off with a line-drive single to right on
a 1-2 pitch from Denny Bautista.

The Coors Field crowd, obviously paying attention, gave Lewis a warm ovation
after his cycle became official. He became the first Giants rookie to reach
this accomplishment since Dave Kingman did so on April 16, 1972, at Houston.

Lewis became the 22nd player in franchise history to hit for the cycle, a
list that includes Hall of Famers Mel Ott, Fred Lindstrom and Bill Terry.
Lewis is also the ninth San Francisco Giant to achieve the feat and the first
to do so since Randy Winn on Aug. 15, 2005, at Cincinnati.

For good measure, Lewis singled again with two outs in the seventh off Denny
Bautista toward the end of a six-run inning. Lewis, who also struck out in
the second inning, became the first Giant to collect five hits in a game
since Pedro Feliz and Deivi Cruz had five apiece on Aug. 16, 2005, at
Cincinnati.
