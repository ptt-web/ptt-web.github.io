Giants overwhelmed by Padres
Night of futility at plate bounces SF from NL West contention
By Rich Draper / MLB.com



SAN DIEGO -- The Giants&#39; final hopes for a divisional title flickered and died
 -- well, maybe more like a fire being stamped out -- as they watched the San
Diego Padres romp to the National League West crown in a 9-1 victory Wednesday
 night at PETCO Park.
It was no shock for the San Franciscans -- they faced astronomical odds -- but
 the defeat was still a blow to the heart for a team that roared back from 11
games out of first before the midway point and made a gallant, if futile,
final chase.

Leave it to manager Felipe Alou, a baseball man for nearly half a century, to
summarize a season that was going nowhere but ended going somewhere -- up the
divisional ladder midway through the final week.

The Giants were game, they were relentless, their spirits indomitable.

And Alou loved them for that.

&#34;I&#39;m smiling,&#34; were the first words out of Felipe&#39;s mustachioed mouth
post-game.

&#34;I addressed the team, the trainers, the doctors and everybody, because I
believe the effort was superb. A team that had to go through what it went
through -- to be eliminated with four days to go, and be the last team
eliminated.

&#34;I think the effort has to be appreciated,&#34; said Alou. &#34;If you look at the
record, we had a bad season, but when you look at the effort, we had a good
season.&#34;

The Giants played with pride, hustle and determination all season, said the
skipper, despite injuries and inexplicable problems and losing streaks -- and
the big man, Barry Bonds, being out for most of the campaign, and slugger
Moises Alou gutting it out when bruised and battered, with catcher Mike
Matheny seemingly playing every day, around the clock.

&#34;We could easily have given up, fighting the Rockies for last place,&#34; said
Alou. &#34;There were many fears -- below .500 was something I never thought would
 happen, but it did. Losing 100 games was a possibility, then 90 games. All of
 those terrible things were within reach -- not first place, but the grave was
 within reach many, many times.

&#34;But those guys made sure it didn&#39;t happen,&#34; he said.

Even right-hander Jason Schmidt, who despite a still-injured groin started
Wednesday&#39;s game as the Giants last great hope ... even he made sure it didn&#39;t
 happen.

Schmidt said how his leg felt was irrelevant, but his mechanics were off this
night and was rocked for six hits and four runs over only four innings --
strictly un-Schmidt like.



Trailing 2-0 in the first, then 5-0 by the sixth, it was fairly hopeless, and
there would be no unbelievable rerun of Colorado, when they stormed back from
a 6-0 deficit to win, 7-6.

A final three-run burst by the Padres in the seventh doomed the Giants for
good.

&#34;The arm felt good, but mechanically I just couldn&#39;t get going,&#34; said Schmidt
(12-7). &#34;I couldn&#39;t line up my arm with the lower half and give myself a
chance to throw strikes. That&#39;s the name of the game, and I just didn&#39;t do
that.&#34;

Was it a product of making only two starts since Sept. 9?

&#34;You can say whatever -- you hope you roll out of bed and throw as many
strikes as you want to,&#34; said Schmidt, who praised his teammates for not
giving up over the second half and the team winning eight of its last 11 games
 prior to Wednesday&#39;s contest.

&#34;We battled our butts off, the guys played hard and pitched hard and [did]
everything,&#34; he said. &#34;To get this far makes it that much tougher. The most
disappointing time of the season is the day you get knocked out.&#34;

Matheny, bone-tired like the rest of the players, said it was too soon to put
the season in perspective, even with that final rush. Did the effort mean
anything?

&#34;Not right now,&#34; he said. &#34;Maybe later. But not right now. It&#39;s too early now.
 All you do is keep playing and don&#39;t think about other things except playing
the game right.&#34;

Veteran Scott Eyre wasn&#39;t in a chipper mood himself, but he still quipped the
Giants could get a second-place check. The team is now tied for No. 2 with the
 Diamondbacks and will have a three-game showdown at SBC Park starting Friday.

&#34;Second place, obviously, is the first loser, but I&#39;ll still take the first
loser as opposed to third place,&#34; said Eyre, buoyed somewhat by Alou&#39;s
postgame address. &#34;Felipe loves the game of baseball, plain and simple, and he
 admired the fact guys played hard every day for him.&#34;
