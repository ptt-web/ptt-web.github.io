Bonds homers to back classic Cain
Feliz also goes deep; Aurilia&#39;s streak ends at 14

ninth inning and nothing in between. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)



SAN FRANCISCO -- Starter Matt Cain finally collected the win that eluded him
this season after the Giants defeated the D-backs, 2-1, on Sunday afternoon.
Despite allowing only three hits in his past two starts, Cain hadn&#39;t earned a
win entering Sunday&#39;s game.

&#34;Before tonight he&#39;d given up three hits and didn&#39;t have a win to show for it,
 and then he comes back and throws the ball the way he did today,&#34; manager
Bruce Bochy said. &#34;That&#39;s such a great job.&#34;

Cain had help from home runs by Barry Bonds and Pedro Feliz as San Francisco
captured the series sweep against Arizona. The win improved the Giants to 9-8
, which inches them above .500 for the first time this season.

Cain earned the win by throwing a complete game in which he allowed only three
 hits and one run.

&#34;For me, though, it&#39;s not about getting the win, it&#39;s about getting the whole
team a win,&#34; Cain said. &#34;That&#39;s what we&#39;re all here to do.&#34;

Heading into the ninth, Cain was on his way to throwing a one-hit shutout. The
 right-hander gave up a leadoff single in the first inning, and didn&#39;t allow a
 hit through the next 26 batters.

He spent the next eight innings working batters on the inside and outside of
the plate, and drew 13 flyouts.

&#34;This is the first time I&#39;ve seen him pitch close up,&#34; Rich Aurilia said. &#34;
He&#39;s as advertised.&#34;

But nerves and an elevated pitch count led to an uncharacteristic ninth. The
D-backs opened the ninth against Cain with two singles, putting runners on the
 corner. The damage could have been worse, but Orlando Hudson hit into a
double play.

Cain then walked a runner, and the bullpen continued to warm up, but Ray
Durham saved the complete game by sprawling for a grounder, rolling over and
barely making the out from the ground.

&#34;It was probably [Cain&#39;s] last hitter, so I was very relieved,&#34; catcher Bengie
 Molina said. &#34;I wanted him to finish the whole game and not have someone
finish for him.&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s nothing more confidence-building then [Bochy] letting me go ahead and
 complete the ninth, even though I got into some trouble there,&#34; Cain said.

That ninth-inning run ended Cain&#39;s streak of scoreless frames at 15. In the
last 27 of 29 innings he pitched, Cain has allowed one or fewer hits. He is
also part of a rotation that leads the National League with a combined 2.81
ERA.

Bonds launched long ball No. 740 on the first pitch he saw into the arcade
behind right field a few feet shy of McCovey Cove with two outs in the fourth
inning. The shot went straight out, with barely any arch. Yusmeiro Petit
became pitcher No. 438 to be lit up by Bonds for a home run.

&#34;This guy is going to go down as one of the greatest players of all time. I&#39;m
still amazed, even though I get to see it every day,&#34; Bochy said.

With the homer, his sixth of the season, Bonds is now 16 away from taking over
 Hank Aaron&#39;s record.

But before Bonds moved one closer to making history, Feliz pounded his second
home run of the season into the left-field stands in the third inning, off
Petit.

Durham provided the only other offense of the game with a single in the
seventh. Durham has now hit safely in the past 16 of 17 games.

Omar Vizquel was presented with his 11th Gold Glove before the game, but he
went 0-for-3 against Petit. Petit was throwing effectively, but Vizquel hit
the ball hard three times and was robbed by Arizona&#39;s defense. In the sixth
inning, Vizquel walloped what looked like a double, but center fielder Eric
Byrnes made a leaping layout to snag the line drive.

Aurilia also went hitless on Sunday, ending his 14-game hit, which was the
longest of his career.

The sweep over Arizona was the Giants&#39; first three-game series sweep since
Aug. 25-27, 2006, against Cincinnati. The Giants now head to Los Angeles three
 and a half games behind the Dodgers, who are leading the league.
