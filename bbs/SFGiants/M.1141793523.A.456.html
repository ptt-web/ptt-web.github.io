United States edges Mexico in opener
Pair of solo homers from Lee, Jones just enough to win
By Barry M. Bloom / MLB.com


PHOENIX -- Derrek Lee has won the World Series. He was on the field less than
three years ago when his Florida Marlins shocked the vaunted New York Yankees
and locked up Game 6 on the hallowed Yankee Stadium turf.

That was the tops for Lee, the All-Star first baseman who flirted with the
Triple Crown last season as a member of the Chicago Cubs. Until Tuesday.

&#34;I never would have said this yesterday,&#34; Lee said after Team USA&#39;s 2-0
victory over Mexico in the World Baseball Classic opener for both teams, &#34;but
today, being on the field, I think this means more. It&#39;s like Jake Peavy said,
 &#39;You&#39;re not playing for your city, you&#39;re playing for your country.&#39; When you
 have your country behind you, there&#39;s a lot of responsibility. There&#39;s no
monetary motivation for this. Guys came to this team to play for their country
. It&#39;s as simple as that.&#34;

After Peavy and Mike Timlin were the first of seven pitchers to shut down the
Mexicans on four hits, all of them singles, Lee stirred up the six-hit U.S.
offense with a long fourth-inning home run off Mexico starter Rodrigo Lopez.

Chipper Jones added another solo shot in the seventh, and that was all the
Americans needed in front of 32,727, including a huge contingent from the
local Mexican community, who wore the country colors of red and green, danced
in the aisles, and wildly jeered Alex Rodriguez each time he came to bat.

Asked about the booing, Rodriguez, who chose Team USA over the Dominicans for
this Classic, said he was chided by his new teammates.

&#34;The Rocket was making fun of me. He said, &#39;Did you decline to play for the
Mexican team, too?&#39;&#34; A-Rod said with a laugh.

Timlin pitched a scoreless fourth and earned the win. And Brad Lidge finished
up with a 1-2-3 ninth to record the save.

A U.S. victory over Canada on Wednesday in a 4 p.m. ET start at Chase would
virtually lock up a trip for the U.S. to the second round in Anaheim against
Japan and Korea. Team USA&#39;s third Pool B game is Friday against South Africa
at Scottsdale Stadium. If the U.S. should win this pool, its first game at
Angel Stadium would be against Asian pool-winning Korea at 11 p.m. ET on
Sunday night.

Lee, who started at first base on Tuesday and played the duration, said the
feeling of running around the bases after taking Lopez deep to right-center
with two out in the fourth was unparalleled.

&#34;I was floating, I really was,&#34; Lee said. &#34;It was just a great feeling. Really
 hard to explain. When you hit a home run during the season, you feel like you
 did your job. When you hit a home run in something like this, it&#39;s kind of
different.&#34;

Jones had just replaced Rodriguez as a defensive replacement at third base in
the seventh. He was the second batter in the bottom of the inning, and batting
 left-handed against new Braves teammate, righty reliever Oscar Villarreal,
the switch-hitting Jones went the opposite way to left.

Jones also hit a two-run poke against the San Francisco Giants in a 12-7
tune-up win at Scottsdale Stadium on Sunday.

&#34;I&#39;m just trying to play my way into the lineup. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do,
&#34; Jones said about his early stellar play for Team USA.

But seriously, folks.

&#34;I said the other day after the exhibition game that if I don&#39;t get another
hit the whole tournament, just going around the bases with that USA across my
chest is a career highlight,&#34; Jones said. &#34;To come back and do it again today
and give our bullpen a little breathing room was another huge thrill.&#34;

And this comes from a man who has played in 92 postseason games, all for the
Braves, including a victory in the 1995 World Series.

Peavy started for the U.S., and threw only 23 pitches as he breezed through
his three innings, allowing just an infield single while striking out three.
Because of double plays in the first and second innings, Peavy faced only the
minimum nine batters.

Peavy went down to the bullpen to put in a little extra work, but he never
gave a second thought to leaving the game as planned.

&#34;I wanted to win with everything I had within me,&#34; the 24-year-old San Diego
Padres right-hander said. &#34;I can&#39;t tell you the amount of pride you have when
you put that uniform on. With all of America watching, the coolest thing about
 this -- and Tommy Lasorda said it this morning -- when the Dodgers win a game
, Dodgers fans are happy. America is our fans. We have a pretty big fan base.
We don&#39;t want to walk out there and let those guys down.&#34;
