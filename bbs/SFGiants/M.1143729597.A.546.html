Notes: Alou taps Schmidt for opener
Manager finally reveals Opening Day starter

PHOENIX -- Jason Schmidt would like to take his final spring outing right into
 his next outing, which will be the Giants&#39; Opening Day assignment.
Schmidt pitched six shutout innings and allowed just two hits in the Giants&#39;
12-0 rout of the Athletics on Wednesday as the team broke camp in Arizona and
returned to San Francisco.

After the game, Giants manager Felipe Alou said Schmidt would start again in
five days. It was the first time he officially revealed Schmidt would start
the opener, Monday at San Diego.

&#34;I don&#39;t know if I was really wondering,&#34; Schmidt said about starting the
opener. &#34;I thought it was kind of strange that nobody told us. Still, nobody
has told me.&#34;

Schmidt, who is 4-0 with a 1.50 earned run average in five Cactus League
starts, walked one and struck out one.

&#34;They were swinging,&#34; Schmidt said. &#34;My 0-2 pitches are still not where I want
 to be. I wasn&#39;t trying to get strikeouts. I was happy to get the pop-ups and
ground balls. It&#39;s a positive note to go out on. There&#39;s an old saying, &#39;good
spring, bad year. Bad spring, good year.&#39; [Last year] I had a bad spring, bad
year, so hopefully this will be a reversal.&#34;

Schmidt&#39;s definition of a &#34;bad year&#34; was a 12-7 record with a 4.40 ERA. He
missed two starts in May with a right shoulder strain, left a Sept. 7 start
with a right groin strain, and pitched only twice in the final three weeks.

&#34;Different workout program, different throwing program,&#34; Schmidt said of his
offseason training regimen. &#34;Everything was pretty much completely different
from what I&#39;ve done in the past. My body was a little more able to do some
stuff this winter. It was the first winter in two or three years that I was
able to work out hard and address some issues.&#34;

All Alou wants is a healthy Schmidt and the desired results should be there.

&#34;He&#39;s never been seriously hurt, but he&#39;s been having these nagging problems,&#34;
 Alou said. &#34;We haven&#39;t seen that this spring. He&#39;s had a very healthy spring.
 Remember last year, he was complaining a little bit of a dead arm in Spring
Training. We haven&#39;t heard any of that.

&#34;Last year wasn&#39;t so good of a year for him, but it was not even a bad year
because he missed quite a bit. I&#39;m not talking Cy Young, but I&#39;m talking about
 if he can back and start 30 or more games. That&#39;s what we&#39;re looking for. If
he does that, he&#39;s going to be right back where he was two years ago [18-7,
3.20 ERA].&#34;

Bat day: The Giants hit seven home runs on Wednesday, including two off
starter Barry Zito and two off A&#39;s closer Huston Street.

&#34;The hitters have been hitting all spring, really hitting the ball,&#34; Alou
said.

Mike Matheny and Omar Vizquel connected off Zito, while Todd Greene hit a
three-run shot and Jason Ellison added a solo blast off Street.

Steve Finley, Pedro Feliz and Abraham Nunez also homered.

The Giants, who had 17 hits against four A&#39;s pitchers, exit Arizona with a
.314 average.

Hot spring: Finley went 2-for-4 with three RBIs to raise his average to .419.

&#34;Wow,&#34; Alou said of Finley&#39;s spring. &#34;It complicates in a good way the
situation.&#34;

Finley is slated to be the fourth outfielder behind Barry Bonds, Randy Winn
and Moises Alou.

&#34;Finley is going to play even if everybody is healthy, and he is going to play
 center field when he plays,&#34; Felipe Alou said.

Injury update: Bonds, who returned to San Francisco a day earlier than the
team, could be in the lineup on Thursday. He has been out with a strained
right elbow. ... Ray Durham, who has been out with a foot injury, is expected
to play on Friday.

Roster move: The Giants designated for assignment left-handed pitcher Jon
Coutlangus to make roster space for Jamey Wright, who will be the No. 5
starter. Wright, who was a non-roster invite to Spring Training, had his
contract officially purchased on Wednesday and was added to the Major League
roster. Coutlangus, a converted outfielder, went 4-0 with a 3.04 ERA in 50
relief appearances last year with San Jose.

Upcoming: Matt Morris will start against the Angels on Thursday at 7:15 p.m.
PT at AT&amp;T Park. Jered Weaver will start for the Angels.
