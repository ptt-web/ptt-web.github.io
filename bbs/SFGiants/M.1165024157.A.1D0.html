SAN FRANCISCO -- Veteran infielder Ray Durham, whose
career with the Giants seemed to be flagging, erupted
with a sensational 2006 campaign and was rewarded with
a two-year contract, San Francisco general manager
Brian Sabean announced Friday. The San Jose Mercury News
reported that the deal is worth $14 million.

Durham, oft-injured during three previous seasons with San Francisco,
stayed relatively healthy last season and stung the opposition by b
atting .293 and boasting career highs with 26 homers and 93 RBIs.

&#34;We are fortunate to re-sign Ray Durham and keep him in a Giants
uniform,&#34; Sabean said in the team&#39;s official news release. &#34;His
switch-hitting abilities and increased power numbers serve as
a needed commodity for our evolving team. He has impressed us
with his ability to transform his game from a top of the order
run scorer to a middle of the lineup run producer.&#34;

Durham, who celebrated his 35th birthday Thursday, proved bountiful
 batting fifth in the lineup behind slugger Barry Bonds and logged a
.538 slugging percentage and batted an impressive .331 with runnners
 in scoring position, a .392 mark after June 27.

His signing has other implications, especially for third baseman
Pedro Feliz, who hit only .244 and struggled defensively while
playing in 160 games.

Although Feliz boasted 96 RBIs and 22 homers, he wore down during
 the season, and the Giants are expected to ink free agent Rich Aurilia
 on Saturday to a two-year deal worth about $7 million and put him
 at third.

Aurilia, who starred for San Francisco from 1996 to 2003, comes off
 two solid seasons at Cincinnati, where he hit .300 last season.

With Durham&#39;s re-signing, that means 24-year-old infield prospect
 Kevin Frandsen will get more valuable tutoring from Durham while
 coming off the bench.

Also expected to sign Saturday for three years and $17 million is center
 fielder Dave Roberts, a free agent who played left field for San Diego.
 His hiring means Randy Winn will move to right field.

Durham, a 12-year Major Leaguer, addressed leg issues by getting stronger
 last season and also showing better control while running, such as not
 going full-out on routine popups and getting better defensive reads.

His power numbers were especially impressive, and his homer output
was the second highest by a switch-hitter in franchise history,
behind only J.T. Snow&#39;s 28 homers in 1997.

Durham&#39;s RBI total was also topped among National League
second basemen only by Philadelphia&#39;s Chase Utley (100),
while his homers were third base behind Utley&#39;s 31 and Florida&#39;s
Dan Uggla&#39;s 27
