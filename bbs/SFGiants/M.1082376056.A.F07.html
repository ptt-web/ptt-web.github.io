Double shot by Bonds too little
By Rich Draper / MLB.com


SAN FRANCISCO -- It&#39;s not just home plate anymore at SBC Park -- it&#39;s The
Launching Pad.
As in three ... two ... one ... liftoff for another Barry Bonds muscle-powered,
suborbital satellite, one of a continuing series of rocket shots exploring the
upper reaches of the baseball stratosphere.

Yeah, but, Hou ... er, San Francisco, we&#39;ve got a problem. A big one.

Bonds did smack career home runs No. 664 and 665 Sunday against Los Angeles and
 drove in five runs, but the SBC gantry wasn&#39;t just for the home folks, as the
Dodgers blasted three consecutive four-baggers in the fifth, powering the
visitors to a 7-6 victory over the Giants.

The win gave the West Division-leading Dodgers a sweep of the three-game series
 and sent San Francisco to its shocking fourth straight defeat and third
consecutive one-run loss.

Close is nice, but continually close losses can be maddening, especially after
San Francisco led the baseball world in winning one-run games last season with
a brilliant 28-11 record. This season, they&#39;re 1-4.


But if the 5-7 Giants -- a veteran team and defending National League West
champs -- are getting overanxious or depressed because of the poor start, Bonds
 hasn&#39;t seen it. Besides, it&#39;s early, only the third week of the season.

&#34;We&#39;re not frustrated, not yet,&#34; said Bonds. &#34;You win, you lose, that&#39;s the
bottom line, no matter what anyone does. It&#39;s about W&#39;s. We need to start doing
 it when we need to, that&#39;s all. I don&#39;t know how we do that yet. We can&#39;t keep
 coming alive when it&#39;s at the end.&#34;

Manager Felipe Alou says he has never panicked during his career and he&#39;s not
about to start now. The offense perked up Sunday with 12 hits, although the
club just fell short. Again.

&#34;It tells us we have to turn it up a notch, to be better than what we are right
 now -- instead of losing by one, winning by one,&#34; said Alou. &#34;But had
opportunities today, and I have to go back a long way to remember when we had
so many opportunities to score at least one -- at least hitting into a double
play and scoring one.&#34;

Losing pitcher Brett Tomko -- who yielded 35 homer last season for St. Louis,
second in the Majors to current Giants hurler Wayne Franklin (36 with Milwaukee
) -- hadn&#39;t given up any this year over two outings, but the dingers came back
to haunt him Sunday.

The right-hander felt troubled from the onset, not spotting his pitches, not
feeling confident.

That caught up with him in the fifth as Adrian Beltre, Juan Encarnacion and
David Ross ruined Tomko&#39;s day by hitting back-to-back-to-back blasts for a
six-run frame and a lead never to be surmounted.

&#34;I was just getting by early in the game, getting out of jams, and pretty much
couldn&#39;t locate anything, couldn&#39;t throw my fastball where I wanted to, getting
 behind guys, making bad pitches,&#34; he said.

Alou said he thought the blows by Encarnacion and Ross were decent offerings,
but the downcast hurler disagreed.


&#34;They were bad pitches if you ask me,&#34; said Tomko. &#34;When you fall behind guys
and [don&#39;t] hit your spots, that&#39;s a recipe for destruction right there.&#34;

Tomko (0-1, 8.16) left the field to something rare for a home player here --
boos -- while the longtime-simmering Giants-Dogers rivalry suddenly has San
Franciscans boiling more than usual.

&#34;They&#39;re tough,&#34; said Tomko of the Dodgers, who finished 15 1/2 games behind
the Giants last season in the West. &#34;They have speed up top and Shawn [Green]
is swinging the bat well. Throw [Milton] Bradley in the mix and Juan
Encarnacion and they&#39;re a lot better than they were last year.&#34;

And the boos?

&#34;It was not fun -- anytime you hear boos the first time out in front of the
home crowd, it&#39;s tough,&#34; he said. &#34;I didn&#39;t exactly put on a great show for
them to applaud.&#34;


Reliever Matt Herges, a former Dodgers castoff, was among Giants feeling poorly
 after the game. This one stung, this one hurt. San Francisco had throttled the
 Dodgers with an 8-2 mark at home in 2003 and won the overall series 13-6.

But 0-3 right out of the rivalry chute?

&#34;It stinks,&#34; said Herges. &#34;But we do go there this weekend and return the favor
. They&#39;re riding high right now, but it&#39;s way early -- way early. Without a
doubt, people are getting big hits and thank God they&#39;re still pitching to
Barry. Every time he&#39;s up I&#39;m saying no way they&#39;re pitching to him again.

&#34;He&#39;s incredible. I believe we&#39;re going to lead the world in one-run games
again and that&#39;s the way it&#39;s starting out. It&#39;ll make us a better club. And
right now it&#39;s not panic time.&#34;
