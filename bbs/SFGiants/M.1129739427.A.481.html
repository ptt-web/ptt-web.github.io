San Francisco Giants

Back in April, the Giants could not go a sentence without being described as
aging. Bonds, Matheny, Vizquel, Snow, Alou. Wherever we looked, the Giants
had someone over 35 staring back. So, it actually came to my surprise when I
found a decent number of rookies that had an impact on the G-men.

One of the spots that demanded a lot of rookie attention was the outfield,
with Barry Bonds out. Early in the season the team turned very often to Jason
Ellison, a good fourth outfielder because of his good defense and gap power.
The club also brought Todd Linden up at some point, as AAA had not been
posing much of a threat at that point. However, Linden then hit just .216 in
171 at-bats, confirming many suspicions that Linden might be a AAAA All-Star.

The other spot on the diamond in need of help was at first base when J.T.
Snow missed time. The team turned to Lance Niekro out of necessity, but the
26-year-old impressed with a solid season. However, the Giants would be best
suited to find a left-handed hitting first baseman this winter, as Niekro
makes the perfect platoon partner. In 108 at-bats, Niekro hit .324/.361/.657
against southpaws, but just .206/.251/.335 against right-handers. If only
Jacque Jones played first, right?

A final area that was constantly in need of help this season was the san
Francisco bullpen. In their quest to find an arm to handle late-game innings,
the Giants stumbled across Scott Munter, who would pitch in 45 games for the
Giants. And despite a very, VERY low strikeout rate, Munter&#39;s good season
probably bought him another. Besides Munter, both Jeremy Accardo and Jack
Taschner were aked to pitch quite a bit this season.

Finally, I want to mention that Matt Cain&#39;s big September will leave him as a
borderline case for my prospect list this winter. If he misses due to too
many innings, it&#39;s a good thing for Giants fans, as they probably wish that
Cain had pitched every inning in 2005.
