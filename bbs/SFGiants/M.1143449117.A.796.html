Team: Bonds has elbow inflammation
Trainer calls diagnosis &#39;best-case&#39; scenario

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds was diagnosed
with inflammation in his left elbow, a best-case scenario, said Giants head
trainer Stan Conte on Sunday.
The finding was reached after Bonds underwent an MRI late Saturday and was
examined by Dr. Ken Akizuki, the Giants&#39; orthopedic surgeon, and Dr. Lewis
Yocum, the Angels&#39; orthopedic specialist, who oversaw Bonds&#39; recovery from
last year&#39;s three surgeries on his right knee.

&#34;It feels much better today,&#34; Bonds told MLB.com on Sunday. &#34;Maybe there&#39;s a
few bone chips in it. That&#39;s my guess, but I don&#39;t know. I can play through
that. No problem. I only need one arm to swing the bat anyway.&#34;

The lefty-swinging left fielder, who is about to embark on an historic run at
the all-time home run record, said he probably wouldn&#39;t play again in a Cactus
 League game this spring, but would most likely be back in the lineup on
Thursday night in San Francisco when the Giants play the Angels at AT&amp;T Park.

Bonds was scratched from Saturday&#39;s lineup against the Chicago White Sox when
he was scheduled to DH and bat cleanup at Scottsdale Stadium against the
defending World Series champions. The Giants ultimately won, 19-7.

Bonds felt a jolt in the elbow while taking a swing during batting practice.
He was given treatment and told to go home. Bonds was immediately placed on
anti-inflammatory medicine, Conte said.

&#34;It just happened yesterday out of the blue,&#34; Bonds said. &#34;I swung and it was
like -- pow! It just blew up. But it&#39;s not swollen today.&#34;

Bonds was in left field on Friday and played seven innings during a 6-4 Giants
 victory over the Colorado Rockies. He went 1-for-3 with a single and a walk.
On Sunday, he remained in street clothes and arrived early at the clubhouse.
By mid-morning, he was taken for another consultation with Akizuki and Yocum.
Conte said the examination was uneventful.

&#34;[The doctors] were very happy with what they saw,&#34; Conte said later in the
day through a team spokesman.

The Giants lost, 6-5, to the San Diego Padres in Peoria on Sunday, but Bonds
hadn&#39;t been scheduled beforehand to make the trip.

Conte said Bonds should be available for all baseball activities on Monday,
when San Francisco plays its final home game of the spring against the Kansas
City Royals.

&#34;We&#39;re still going to be very cautious,&#34; Conte said. &#34;But everything looks
very good. If it continues like this, it will just be a small glitch on the
screen.&#34;


About Bonds playing, Conte added: &#34;We&#39;re going to be ultra-conservative. We
have 162 games to go. I think if he does what we expect him to do this year,
nobody is going to look back and say, &#39;He missed a Spring Training game.&#39;&#34;

Bonds said he probably would return to the Bay Area on Tuesday and work out at
 AT&amp;T Park on Wednesday. The Giants play the Rockies on Tuesday in Tucson and
break camp after their game against Oakland on Wednesday in Phoenix.

They play the Angels on Thursday night and then three games against the A&#39;s
before opening the season a week from Monday in San Diego. The Friday night
and Sunday afternoon games are in San Francisco, while the Saturday afternoon
game is in Oakland.

Even before the elbow problem, Bonds was scheduled to only play on Thursday
night and Saturday.

&#34;They don&#39;t want me to do anything right now,&#34; Bonds said about his upcoming
schedule. &#34;They told me, &#39;You&#39;ve got enough problems with your legs. Just go
upstairs [to the training room] and do your work.&#39; That&#39;s fine with me. The
only thing is I have to keep myself in shape and keep myself in that sort of
baseball mode. Once you&#39;re in the groove, you don&#39;t want to lose it. And right
 now I&#39;ve really been consistent, playing right.

&#34;I&#39;ve been working with [center fielder] Steve Finley and we&#39;ve been
communicating so well in the outfield. You don&#39;t want to lose that when things
 are going good. Hopefully, those things won&#39;t get messed up.&#34;

Bonds has spent the spring rebuilding strength in the right knee.

Thus far, Bonds has played in seven spring games and is batting .625 with 10
hits, four homers, seven runs scored and nine RBIs in just 16 at-bats.

At 41, he goes into the season with 708 homers, six behind Babe Ruth&#39;s 714 and
 47 behind Hank Aaron&#39;s 755.

Bonds has had problems with his elbow before. Early in the 1999 season, Bonds
had surgery to remove a bone spur and repair a damaged triceps tendon. He
missed 60 games that season, far and away the most of his 20-year career until
 he sat out 148 games in 2005 because of the multiple knee surgeries,
including the first 142 of the season.

Conte, though, said there was probably no correlation between the current
elbow discomfort and the 1999 surgery.

&#34;This morning he is much, much, much improved,&#34; Conte said. &#34;In fact, he could
 probably play today if this was the regular season. This is the best case we
could hope for, especially when he came in today felling so good.&#34;
