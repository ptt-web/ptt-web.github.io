Notes: Schmidt enjoying newfound &#39;life&#39;
Wright shining in fifth-starter battle; Benitez back in action
By Rich Draper / MLB.com


SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- It wasn&#39;t the Jason Schmidt of last season with a dead
arm and cerebrally feeling as if he was &#34;on a different planet&#34; Friday, but
more like the Giants pitcher in contention for the Cy Young Award in 2003 and
2004.
See that little spurt, that jump, at the end of his pitches?

It&#39;s what Schmidt calls, colloquially, &#34;giddyup&#34; or &#34;life&#34; -- not exactly
movement or velocity but last-millisecond oomph as the ball nears the plate --
 and it was back with a vengeance.

The 33-year-old Schmidt continued his wonderful spring with seven innings of
five-hit ball in the Giants&#39; 6-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies at
Scottsdale Stadium, lowering the right-hander&#39;s ERA over four outings to 2.00
and all but assuring him the Opening Day starter&#39;s role for San Francisco on
April 3 against the San Diego Padres in PETCO Park.

&#34;It looks like it&#39;s shaping up that way,&#34; said manager Felipe Alou. &#34;I hope
it&#39;s Schmitty -- everything is moving towards him.&#34;

As usual, Schmidt shrugged at the opener possibility, wondering what all the
fuss is about.

&#34;I don&#39;t know what the big secret is,&#34; said Schmidt, who last pitched Opening
Day for San Francisco in 2003.

This is a more confident Schmidt, who staggered to a below-par 12 victories
last season and a highest-as-a-Giant 4.40 ERA. He&#39;s stronger now in legs and
spirit, and his old presence is back.

After being on the disabled list for three of the last four years and battling
 groin problems in 2005, Schmidt worked diligently and differently over the
winter and it&#39;s paid off.

That wildness from last year is gone, and that little explosion at the tail
end of his fastball still shocks the hitters.

&#34;It&#39;s just kind of the second stage of the ball at it comes out of your hand,
and sometimes there&#39;s a little giddyup at the end,&#34; Schmidt said. &#34;Last year,
it felt like it was slowing down from the moment it got out of my hand until
it it was there.&#34;

Wright more than all right: All the pieces finally seem in place now for a
breakout year by Giants pitcher Jamey Wright.

It&#39;s been long in coming.

Editors have typed out the headline &#34;Wright reaching potential&#34; for about
seven seasons -- it was more about guesswork and finger-crossing than reality
-- yet the 31-year-old right-hander feels almost giddy about being with San
Francisco this spring.


&#34;There&#39;s a lot of confidence in this clubhouse and I feel good wearing this
jersey -- maybe that&#39;s it,&#34; said Wright, who said he wouldn&#39;t mind pitching
next Tuesday in Tucson against the Rockies, which would settle him into a
fifth slot.

&#34;I only threw 54 pitches [Friday] and that&#39;s very easy to come back three days
 after that,&#34; he said.

Alou said Wright&#39;s solid spring -- he hasn&#39;t given up an earned run in three
Cactus League appearances and yielded one tally against Team USA in an
exhibition -- has given the veteran the &#34;inside track&#34; for the fifth rotation
spot.

&#34;I gotta say yes,&#34; said Alou, before adding, &#34;tomorrow it might be somebody
else. But after today, how can we leave him off [the roster]?&#34;

Wright admits this is the best spring he&#39;s had in the Majors, and everything
was working this day.

&#34;I had a good sinker, a good little cutter going both ways, a curveball that
came around the last game that was even better today,&#34; said Wright. &#34;I was
getting ahead of guys and throwing strikes.&#34;

Wright said being on a winning club could turn his career around, and he&#39;s
sure in a great mood heading into the regular season.

&#34;I had good games and bad games at Coors Field, and I&#39;m excited about what
this season could bring,&#34; said Wright, who has a 61-88 big-league record and
5.13 ERA. &#34;I feel like I&#39;ve put myself in a good position.&#34;

Hennessey&#39;s woes: Fifth-starter candidate Brad Hennessey, who gave up four
earned runs and three walks over 4 1/3 innings against Milwaukee in Maryvale
on Thursday, said he never got untracked.

&#34;I couldn&#39;t get in a rhythm; I felt my body was all over the place,&#34; said
Hennessey. &#34;You have days like that -- at least it wasn&#39;t as bad as it could
have been.&#34;

Reliever Jeff Fassero got Hennessey and the Giants out of a jam in the fifth,
yet defensive miscues and bizarre happenings also played havoc with Hennessey.

One double-play ball hit a runner, opening the door for a Brewers rally, while
 the Giants committed three errors.

&#34;You&#39;ve got to go out and get the next guy, get another ground ball,&#34; he said
of the aborted double play. &#34;How many times do you see that? But you can&#39;t
blame anybody, then you&#39;d be a crybaby.&#34;

The right-hander should get one more Spring Training start before the regular
season starts.

Bonds, Benitez look sound: Barry Bonds played excellent defense and caught one
 high fly in the gap that center fielder Steve Finley had hustled over to
retrieve just in case. Bonds had an RBI single and will be the designated
hitter Saturday against the White Sox at Scottsdale Stadium.

&#34;Barry was a tremendous outfielder and his sense of getting a good jump is
still there,&#34; commented Alou. &#34;I thought it was a double, but he made it look
easy.&#34;

Closer Armando Benitez pitched one hitless inning vs. the Rockies and showed
no discomfort with his left knee, which had been inflamed.

&#34;He has a healthy knee, threw strikes and was better [landing on his left leg]
,&#34; said Alou, noting Benitez was still wearing a brace.

Coming up: Giants right-hander Matt Morris (0-1, 6.00 ERA) makes his fourth
Cactus League start and first against the world champion Chicago White Sox on
Saturday at 12:05 p.m. PT at Scottsdale Stadium. He&#39;ll oppose lefty Tyler
Lumsden (0-0, 0.00).
