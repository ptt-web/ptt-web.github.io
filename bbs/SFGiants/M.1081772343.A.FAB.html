Giants rally to snap losing streak
Bonds still seeking Mays-tying homer
By Rich Draper / MLB.com


SAN DIEGO -- The Giants avoided getting swept in San Diego for the first since
1998 when they rallied for five runs in the eighth inning to score a 6-3
victory over the Padres at PETCO Park on Sunday, halting a three-game losing
streak.

The critical frame started innocently enough with Ray Durham flying out against
 reliever Scott Linebrink. San Francisco had been shut out by Padres starter
Jake Peavy through seven innings, and it looked as if the Giants bats would
remain asleep.

Nope. A wakeup call came as they loaded the bases on a double by Marquis
Grissom and a walk to J.T Snow and an intentional pass to Barry Bonds.
Pinch-hitter Pedro Feliz&#39;s single off Jay Witasick scored two runs, then Bonds
romped home with the tying run on Edgardo Alfonzo&#39;s single.

The Giants loaded the sacks again as Michael Tucker walked, then Neifi Perez
drilled a two-run single to right field off Antonio Osuna. In the ninth, San
Francisco added a run when Tucker walked, scoring Grissom.

Felix Rodriguez pitched a scoreless eighth for the Giants, while Matt Herges
earned his third save.

San Francisco needed a strong performance from starter Brett Tomko, and they
got it.

Tomko breezed through the first three innings, retiring the first nine batters
he faced, but the Padres erupted for three runs in the fourth as Sean Burroughs
 and Mark Loretta singled, then Brian Giles ripped a triple off the right-field
 wall. The relay from second baseman Ray Durham skipped by third base, enabling
 Giles to score.

Tomko allowed only four hits over six frames.

Peavy proved masterful, but his effort was wasted. He got into trouble in the
sixth, as Snow singled to right and went to third when Bonds hit an
opposite-field double down the left-field line. But A.J. Pierzynski ended the
threat on a groundout to second.

Bonds went homerless for the fifth straight game after hitting homer No. 659
-- one short of Willie Mays&#39; 660 career blows -- in the season opener at
Houston last Monday.

In a positive note for San Francisco, reliever Jason Christiansen pitched the
bottom of the seventh and didn&#39;t allow a run. He had pitched to only two
batters before, walking them both. He opened the frame by walking Ryan Klesko
and giving up a single to Terrence Long.

But Ramon Hernandez hit into a double play, and after strolling Khalil Greene,
Christiansen induced pinch-hitter Jay Payton into an infield popout and picked
up the victory, his first of the season.

The Giants (3-3) head home for Monday&#39;s 1:05 p.m. PT for the SBC Park opener
vs. Milwaukee.
