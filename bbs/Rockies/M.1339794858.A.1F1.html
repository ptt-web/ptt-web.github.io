Colorado Rockies


The Rockies managed to snag some excellent value in this draft. Much like
Stryker Trahan, I’m a big fan of outfielder David Dahl, the club’s top
pick. I think the questions over his speed and power are overblown and I
think the hitting ability and style of play can carry him to big things.

Backing that pick up with Radford right-hander Eddie Butler in the
supplemental round is a good grab. Butler has shown a fastball as high as
96-97 mph at times and while he was really inconsistent this spring, when he
was good, he was damn good. If the Rockies developmental staff can coax some
consistency out of him, he has a chance to be a mid-rotation starter or
dynamic late inning reliever.

The second and third rounds could be a boon for the Rockies. Third rounder
Tom Murphy was much higher on my personal draft board and I think he could
end up being one of the top catchers in this draft class. Outfielder Max
White and right-hander Ryan Warner are classic projectable high school kids
that if signed will provide some nice upside to the lower levels of the
system.

Right-handed reliever Seth Willoughby and right-handed starter TJ Oakes don’
t offer a ton of upside, but both could move quickly and provide big league
value. Willoughby has some setup potential with a fastball that peaks at 95
and a filthy cutter. Oakes is an adept pitcher with the ability to manipulate
the baseball and adjust speeds on his three-pitch mix. His bump in velocity
into the low-90s helps him project at the back of a rotation.

Eighth rounder Derek Jones has an interesting bat that some teams liked more
than others. He shows some feel for hitting and enough power to project for
15-20 home runs annually. As a left-handed hitter with little defensive
value, Jones best profiles as a bench bat.

Two more high school pitchers could give plenty of raw upside to this draft
class. Ninth rounder Zach Jemiola and 20th rounder Anthony Seise are both
projectable young arms that could evolve into very interesting prospects.
Jemiola has flashed mid-90s heat at times but dipped always the way down to
the upper-80s earlier this spring. Seise has shown a variety of positive
traits, including flashes of three pitches and a long, lean body with plenty
of projection.
