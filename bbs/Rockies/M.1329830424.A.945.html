貼資料時間......這一份的差異很大喔 XD

<span class="b4 hl">1. Nolan Arenado</span>
Height: 6&#39; 1&#34;, Weight: 205
ETA: 2013
Position: 3B
Age: 20, DOB: 04/16/1991
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2009, 2nd (59)

Sometimes a player gets knocked unfairly because of his surroundings. It&#39;s not
Arenado&#39;s fault he played in the hitting-friendly California League and then
the equally cozy Arizona Fall League in 2011. What he does deserve credit for
is raking in both places. He led the Minors in RBIs with 122. He struck out
just 53 times all season. Then he won the AFL MVP award, finishing among the
leaders in a host of offensive categories. He should hit for average and even
if he doesn&#39;t hit a ton of homers, he&#39;ll be a run-producer. There once was
concern about his defense at third, but he&#39;s worked to improve and those
worries are gone. He&#39;ll move up to Double-A and it might not be too long before
he&#39;s spotted in Coors Field.




<span class="b4 hl">2. Drew Pomeranz</span>
Height: 6&#39; 5&#34;, Weight: 240
ETA: 2012
Position: LHP
Age: 23, DOB: 11/22/1988
Bats: R, Throws: L
Drafted: 2010, 1st (5)

Jimenez deal, he sat in limbo for a long stretch, unable to pitch, waiting for
his part of the trade to be official. Then he had to have his appendix removed.
Despite all that, he pitched very well for the Rockies and earned his first
callup to the big leagues, throwing five shutout innings in his debut. When
fully healthy, he has a plus fastball and curve. His changeup isn&#39;t quite as
good, but it&#39;s still an effective pitch for the Ole Miss southpaw. If he
commands the ball the way he did in the big leagues late last year -- that has
been an issue for him in the past -- he&#39;ll be just fine. The Rockies pride
themselves on character, so Pomeranz&#39;s offseason arrest didn&#39;t make anyone
happy, but he should get a very long look for a rotation spot this spring.




<span class="b4 hl">3. Wilin Rosario</span>
Height: 5&#39; 11&#34;, Weight: 215
ETA: 2012
Position: C
Age: 22, DOB: 02/23/1989
Bats: R, Throws: R
Signed: Feb. 13, 2006

Rosario made it back from a knee injury, albeit a bit slowly, in 2011. Even so,
he went to his second Futures Game and made his Major League debut in
September. Rosario has a plus arm that can shut down a running game, and he&#39;s
shown some good power as well, with a career slugging percentage close to .450.
He needs to improve his plate discipline and his all-around defense to be ready
for a full-time gig. The signing of Ramon Hernandez should allow Colorado to
send Rosario to Triple-A to work on those things in 2012.



<span class="b4 hl">4. Chad Bettis</span>
Height: 6&#39; 1&#34;, Weight: 200
ETA: 2014
Position: RHP
Age: 22, DOB:04/26/1989
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2010, 2nd (76)

Bettis was a reliever and a starter in college and many felt his future would
be in the back end of a bullpen. The Rockies like him as a starter, and so far,
so good. He has two plus pitches in his fastball and slider. His changeup lags
behind the other two, but it didn’t hurt him in the California League, where
his ability to command the ball and keep it down in the zone made him very
difficult to hit.



<span class="b4 hl">5. Tyler Anderson</span>
Height: 6&#39; 4&#34;, Weight: 215
ETA: 2013
Position: LHP
Age: 22, DOB: 12/30/1989
Bats: L, Throws: L
Drafted: 2011, 1st (20)

Not blessed with great pure stuff, Anderson fits the mold of an advanced
college lefty with outstanding pitchability. The Oregon product throws an
average fastball up to 92 mph. He commands it extremely well, with good
movement. His changeup is well above average and has outstanding action. He
throws two breaking pitches, a show-me curve to get ahead of hitters and a good
slider that goes down and in to right-handed hitters. A not quite as physical
Andy Pettitte type, Anderson does have some deception to his delivery. He may
not have the highest ceiling in the Draft, but he shouldn’t take too long to
get to the big leagues.



<span class="b4 hl">6. Tyler Matzek</span>
Height: 6&#39; 3&#34;, Weight: 210
ETA: 2014
Position: LHP
Age: 21, DOB: 10/19/1990
Bats: L, Throws: L
Drafted: 2009, 1st (11)

There may not have been a prospect in baseball who saw the wheels fall off more
than Matzek in 2011. Credit goes to the Rockies for allowing the lefty to go
home to work with his old pitching coach, and Matzek deserves credit for coming
back and throwing better upon his return. He still has the makings of three
plus pitches in his fastball, curve and changeup, but to say he struggled with
command would be a vast understatement. If he can find the strike zone
consistently, he’s still more than young enough to get back on the right track
toward the Rockies’ rotation.




<span class="b4 hl">7. Tim Wheeler</span>
Height: 6&#39; 4&#34;, Weight: 205
ETA: 2012
Position: OF
Age: 24, DOB:01/21/1988
Bats: L, Throws: R
Drafted: 2009, 1st (32)

Wheeler put a so-so first full season of pro ball behind him with a breakout
2011 that saw him finish tied for second in the Minors in home runs (33) while
stealing 21 bases. The improvement came even as he struck out 142 times, which
might keep him from hitting for too high of an average at the next level.
Although he plays a decent center field, he’ll likely settle into a corner
spot, where he has enough arm and seemingly the power bat to profile there.




<span class="b4 hl">8. Trevor Story</span>
Height: 6&#39; 1&#34;, Weight: 175
ETA: 2015
Position: SS
Age: 19, DOB:11/15/1992
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2011, 1st (45)

The sandwich-round pick had a very solid first summer as a pro, showing why the
Rockies valued him so highly. He is mature beyond his years, allowing his good,
but not plus, tools to play up. Story has an advanced approach at the plate and
he could grow into more power. He does have good speed, and combined with his
instincts, he should steal some bases along the way. His one plus tool is his
arm, and with good range and hands, he should be able to stay at shortstop.
Troy Tulowitzki fans don’t have to worry just yet, and Story could always move
to second or third when and if that time comes.




<span class="b4 hl">9. Zach Putnam</span>
Height: 6&#39; 1&#34;, Weight: 225
ETA: 2012
Position: RHP
Age: 24, DOB:07/03/1987
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2008, 5th (171)

The former two-way player at Michigan made it to Triple-A in his first full
season and made his big league debut in Cleveland’s bullpen last September.
The Rockies acquired the right-hander in return for Kevin Slowey in January,
and he’s poised to join the bullpen. He uses a fastball and a splitter
effectively and also has a slider, which isn’t quite as good as his other two
offerings. He doesn’t have the stuff to close, though he’s handled the role
at times in the Minors, but should be a valuable middle reliever or setup man
in the big leagues.



<span class="b4 hl">10. Peter Tago</span>
Height: 6&#39; 2&#34;, Weight: 170
ETA: 2015
Position: RHP
Age: 19, DOB:07/05/1992
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2010, 1st (47)

Very little went right for this projectable right-hander during his first taste
of full-season ball as Tago walked more batters (72) than he struck out (58)
during his time at Class A Asheville. He’s on this list because of his upside,
athleticism and arm strength. He still has the potential to have a plus
fastball, though his secondary pitches and, obviously, his command need a lot
of work. He has a long way to go, and he does need to show some improvement in
2012, but it’s too early to give up on a guy with this kind of ceiling.



<span class="b4 hl">11. Kyle Parker</span>
Height: 6&#39; 0&#34;, Weight: 200
ETA: 2014
Position: OF
Age: 22, DOB:09/30/1989
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2010, 1st (26)

The former Clemson quarterback showed some offensive potential in the power and
run-production department, but it’s taken with a grain of salt given the
bandbox stadium at Class A Asheville. He was a little too much of a free
swinger at the plate, leading to the high strikeout total, and he had just a
.737 OPS away from home. He has the bat speed, athleticism and strong arm to
still profile well in right field if he can refine his approach.



<span class="b4 hl">12. Rosell Herrera</span>
Height: 6&#39; 3&#34;, Weight: 180
ETA: 2015
Position: SS/3B
Age:19, DOB: 10/16/1992
Bats: S, Throws: R
Signed: July 2, 2009

Herrera split time at short and third in the Pioneer League during his U.S.
debut with Trevor Story, creating quite a 1-2 punch. A switch-hitter with
ability from both sides of the plate, he has the chance to hit for both average
and at least some power. Already pretty big, most feel he’ll outgrow shortstop
and could slide over to third to play alongside Story for years to come.




<span class="b4 hl">13. Charlie Blackmon</span>
Height: 6&#39; 3&#34;, Weight: 210
ETA: 2012
Position: OF
Age: 25, DOB: 07/01/1986
Bats: L, Throws: L
Drafted: 2008, 2nd (72)

After raking in Triple-A, Blackmon got called up to Colorado in June and was
getting regular playing time when he broke his foot in July. Blackmon has good
hitting skills, doesn’t strike out much and gets on base. He runs well enough
to steal some bases and can play all three outfield positions. Whether he’s a
starter or a very good fourth outfielder, it’s clear he has a Major League
future ahead of him.



<span class="b4 hl">14. Christian Friedrich</span>
Height: 6&#39; 4&#34;, Weight: 215
ETA: 2013
Position: LHP
Age:24, DOB: 07/08/1987
Bats: R, Throws: L
Drafted: 2008, 1st (25)

Friedrich’s first full season in 2009 left many hopeful he could make a quick
trip to Colorado. He struggled with injuries in 2010, and then in 2011, though
he was healthy, he didn’t pitch well in his second tour of the Double-A Texas
League. He still has the repertoire to be a successful starter but has taken
some steps backward since his encouraging beginning.



<span class="b4 hl">15. Will Swanner</span>
Height: 6&#39; 2&#34;, Weight: 185
ETA: 2015
Position: C
Age: 20, DOB:09/10/1991
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2010, 15th (470)

There’s little question about Swanner’s power, as he’s hit 17 homers and
slugged .579 in his brief, 61-game pro career. There is a lot of swing-and-miss
to his game and likely always will be, though he did improve his plate
discipline a bit in 2011 before a torn thumb ligament shortened his summer. He
needs a lot of work behind the plate, but if that can come, it’s not easy to
find that kind of power at that position.



<span class="b4 hl">16. Josh Rutledge</span>
Height: 6&#39; 1&#34;, Weight: 190
ETA: 2013
Position: SS
Age: 22, DOB: 04/21/1989
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2010, 3rd (107)

In his first full season, the Alabama product finished second in the California
League in average, third in on-base percentage and fifth in OPS. Not bad for a
middle infielder. Rutledge should continue to hit for average and could develop
a bit more power while stealing a few bases here and there. He may be better
off at second base defensively, which is where he’d have to go anyway because
of Troy Tulowitzki.



<span class="b4 hl">17. Hector Gomez</span>
Height: 6&#39; 2&#34;, Weight: 180
ETA: 2012
Position: SS
Age: 23, DOB: 03/05/1988
Bats: R, Throws: R
Signed: July 29, 2004

Based on ability and tools, Gomez has tremendous upside, and when he’s been on
the field, he’s shown glimpses of using those tools. The problem is that Gomez
hasn’t been able to stay on the field because of injuries. In 2011, it was
back trouble that limited him to 102 games and kept him from getting more
playing time after his first big league callup. If he can stay healthy, he
still has the chance to be an everyday infielder, even if he has to move over
to second.




<span class="b4 hl">18. Danny Winkler</span>
Height: 6&#39; 1&#34;, Weight: 200
ETA: 2014
Position: RHP
Age: 22, DOB: 02/02/1990
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2011, 20th (618)

The Central Florida product got 12 starts in the Pioneer League after being
drafted and threw well, finishing with what would have been the third-lowest
ERA in the league with enough innings and a 10.2 strikeouts-per-nine-innings
rate. He has a pretty solid fastball he commands pretty well to go along with a
swing-and-miss slider. He could end up being a very good short reliever when
all is said and done.



<span class="b4 hl">19. Edwar Cabrera</span>
Height: 6&#39; 0&#34;, Weight: 175
ETA: 2013
Position: LHP
Age: 24, DOB: 10/20/1987
Bats: L, Throws: L
Signed: March 5, 2008

No one in the Minors struck out more batters than the 217 Cabrera posted across
two levels in 2011. One would think, then, that the left-hander possesses a
plus plus fastball or wipeout breaking ball. Instead, it is Cabrera’s plus
changeup that generates all the misses. His other stuff isn’t as good,
limiting his ceiling. Still, it will be interesting to watch what he does for
an encore.




<span class="b4 hl">20 Kent Matthes</span>
Height: 6&#39; 2&#34;, Weight: 215
ETA: 2013
Position: OF
Age: 25, DOB: 01/08/1987
Bats: R, Throws: R
Drafted: 2009, 4th (121)

Matthes had a tremendous offensive season in the California League in 2011,
winning league MVP honors for his ability to hit for average and power. He’s
had trouble staying away from injuries, missing most of 2010 because of knee
surgery and having his 2011 campaign cut short by a broken hand. A senior sign,
he’s starting to get “old” for his level and could start moving more quickly
to become a power-hitting corner outfielder in Colorado.



--------------------

1. 外野雙人組 Wheeler &amp; Parker 竟然會排在投手雙人組 Matzek &amp; Tago 後面
後面那組看的不是對方的打擊成績啊...... 簡直是 大爆發 VS. 大爆炸


2. Josh Rutledge, Ken Matthes, Edwar Cabrera 這三位真是莫名沒愛
尤其 Cabrera 跟 Nicasio 好像，簽下之前沒什麼來頭
就算在低階聯盟超殺但還是被擺在下面很久
球探們對他們的stuff評價都不高，縱使他們有很好的command
今年 Cabrera 可望從 AA 開季
持續屠宰的話也滿有可能循去年 Nicasio 的模式上來頂一下
反正我們現在走了 Street &amp; Lindstrom，牛棚隨時歡迎有人補進 XD
