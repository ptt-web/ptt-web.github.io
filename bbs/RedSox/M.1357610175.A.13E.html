<span class="b1 hl">Boston Red Sox Top 20 Prospects for 2013</span>

<a href="https://t.co/CHiixdop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://t.co/CHiixdop</a>

<span class="f1 hl">1) Xander Bogaerts, SS,</span> <span class="f3 b1 hl">Grade A</span><span class="f1 hl">:</span> Given his age, overall track record, and the
small sample size, I am not worried about the lack of walks in Double-A. He&#39;s
going to be an excellent hitter and there is at least a moderate chance he
can stick at shortstop, at least for awhile. One of the top elite prospects
in the game.

<span class="f4 hl">2) Jackie Bradley, OF, </span><span class="b4 hl">Grade B+</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> Terrific defense, on-base ability, moderate
power, excellent makeup. Sounds like a winner to me and worthy successor to
Jacoby Ellsbury.

<span class="f4 hl">3) Matt Barnes, RHP,</span> <span class="b4 hl">Grade B+</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> I&#39;m a little worried about his wilt in the
second half, otherwise I might have ranked him ahead of Bradley, but overall
he performed up to expectations, looking like a future number two or three
starter to me, assuming any durability issues clear up.

<span class="f4 hl">4) Garin Cecchini, 3B,</span> <span class="b4 hl">Grade B+</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> Borderline B. I assume this grade may
surprise people, but I&#39;m thinking he will start to show more power to go with
his OBP skills, speed, and greatly improved defense. I don&#39;t always play it
safe with the grades.

<span class="f4 hl">5) Allen Webster, RHP,</span> <span class="b5 hl">Grade B</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> Borderline B+. Love the grounders, but needs
to sharpen his command further and refine breaking ball. Another guy who can
be a mid-rotation arm, eat tons of innings.

<span class="f4 hl">6) Henry Owens, LHP,</span> <span class="b5 hl">Grade B</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> He&#39;s got some issues, needs to get the walks
down for example, but the 4.87 ERA overstates his troubles. I like his
physicality, size, delivery, and I think the command will improve.

<span class="f4 hl">7) Bryce Brentz, OF,</span> <span class="b6 hl">Grade B-</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> Borderline B: I think he can develop into
something like Ryan Ludwick but he may need a couple of years to do it. Will
he get that kind of slack?

<span class="f4 hl">8) Blake Swihart, C,</span> <span class="b6 hl">Grade B-</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> So far, he scouts better than he performs.
Defense seems to be coming along, but hitting was disappointing in the Sally
League given all the pre-draft hype his bat received, and at age 20 he was
old for a 2011 high school draft. He&#39;s a solid prospect certainly but I am
going to wait and see beyond that. Catchers have weird development curves,
though, and New Mexico background also factors in.

<span class="f4 hl">9) Brandon Workman, RHP,</span> <span class="b6 hl">Grade B-</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> Not spectacular, but seems like he&#39;ll
become a workhorse arm. If he switches to relief he would be more dominant,
but even the Red Sox need inning eaters.

<span class="f4 hl">10) Deven Marrero, SS,</span> <span class="b6 hl">Grade B-</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> Very good defense and patient at the plate,
could develop some doubles power. I don&#39;t see him as a star but he has a
chance to be a solid regular or a really good utility

<span class="f4 hl">11) Pat Light, RHP,</span> <span class="b6 hl">Grade B-</span><span class="f4 hl">:</span> One of my favorite pitchers from the 2012
draft, I suspect I like him better than many people do but I think he can
improve his changeup enough to start. If not, another guy who could dominate
in relief.

<span class="f3 hl">12) Jose Iglesias, SS,</span> <span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> His glove is excellent but his bat is so bad
that it may be tough to keep him in the lineup anyway. If they are lucky he
can be the Cuban Adam Everett and hold a job with positive WAR even with poor
hitting. If they aren&#39;t lucky, keep in mind that Rey Ordonez had a great
glove but couldn&#39;t hold the job anyway.

<span class="f3 hl">13) Brandon Jacobs, OF,</span> <span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> At this point, the C+ guys could be listed
in just about any order depending on taste. I&#39;ll go with Jacobs here, the
tools hound who had a disappointing season in High-A but is young enough at
age 22 to rebound effectively. Everybody seems to have forgotten about him.

<span class="f3 hl">14) Drake Britton, LHP,</span> <span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> Very erratic, command issues remain, but
has one of the better left-handed arms in the minors. Should be a useful
power bullpen arm if his control doesn&#39;t come around enough for him to start.

<span class="f3 hl">15) Brian Johnson, LHP, </span><span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> Very polished University of Florida lefty
is classic &#34;low upside, high floor&#34; pitcher who should move through system
quickly as an inning-soaking strike-thrower.

<span class="f3 hl">16) Keury De La Cruz, OF,</span> <span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> Great slash line in Low-A
(.308/.352/.536) at age 20 is nice, but poor strike zone discipline and
hesitant scouting reports from non-Red Sox sources give one pause. Obviously
a prospect but I want to see more before buying in completely.

<span class="f3 hl">17) Ty Buttrey, RHP,</span> <span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> Big horse from 2012 draft was fourth round
pick but took first round money to sign. Has a first round arm to go with it,
but it remains to be seen how his command and changeup will work out.
Fastball/knucklecurve combo would make him a good reliever if necessary.

<span class="f3 hl">18) Jose Vinicio, SS, </span><span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> Another tools guy, gets strong reviews on
defense. Fast, has a chance to hit for average, but don&#39;t expect power.

<span class="f3 hl">19) Brock Holt, 2B,</span> <span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> Acquired in Joel Hanrahan trade with Pirates.
Opposite of Vinicio: lacks tools, but knows how to play and persistently
exceeds expectations of scouts. Solid glove at second, good-enough at
shortstop for utility work, should hit for average.

<span class="f3 hl">20) Cody Kukuk, LHP,</span> <span class="b3 hl">Grade C+</span><span class="f3 hl">:</span> My pick for a surprise breakthrough in 2013.
Big lefty with above average fastball and slider, lost most of the season on
restricted list due to DUI charges that were eventually dismissed. Looked
outstanding in August, mechanics and command were more consistent than they
were in high school. If he keeps that up, he will vault up this list next
year. Assuming no more off-field glitches, he *could* turn into Jon Lester.

<span class="b5 hl">OTHER GRADE C+:</span> Sean Coyle, 2B; Austin Maddox, RHP; Travis Shaw, 1B.

<span class="f2 hl">OTHERS:</span> Mike Augliera, RHP; Jamie Callahan, RHP; Chris Carpenter, RHP; Sergio
Gomez, RHP; Alex Hassan, OF; Chris Hernandez, LHP; Aaron Kurcz, RHP; Juan
Carlos Ramirez, OF; Tzu-Wei Lin, SS; Manuel Margot, OF; Simon Mercedes, RHP;
Francellis Montas, RHP; Miguel Pena, LHP; Noe Ramirez, RHP; Anthony Ranaudo,
RHP; Christian Vazquez, C; Alex Wilson, RHP; Steven Wright, RHP.


2012 may have been a disaster at the major league level, but the Red Sox farm
system is in <span class="b1 hl">solid shape.</span> It will take a year or two before the best guys are
ready to contribute, but there is much to look forward to.

On the positional side, <span class="b1 hl">the class of the group is obviously Xander Bogaerts,</span>
<span class="b1 hl">who has the ability to be the next great Red Sox star.</span> He destroyed High-A
and dominated Double-A in August at the age of 19. Yes, he has a few issues
to work through, but given the skill growth that he&#39;s already shown, <span class="f3 b1 hl">I am</span>
<span class="f3 b1 hl">confident in his ability to adapt as necessary.</span> Jackie Bradley will be ready
to hold down a center field job in 2014. Bryce Brentz may have some hiccups
due to contact issues, but if they stick with him he should be a productive
slugger. Bradley and Brentz alongside each other in the outfield in 2014? I
think Holt can be a nice complementary role player.

If Jose Iglesias&#39; bat proves too weak to hold his job, Deven Marrero and Jose
Vinicio provide other defense-oriented options. Tools guys at the lower
levels like De La Cruz and the expensive international signees provide
another wave behind the top group, though we&#39;ll have to see how they pan out
of course. I&#39;m taking a risk by saying that Cecchini can develop more home
run power and grading him accordingly, but that&#39;s what sleep deprivation does
to my brain I guess.

The pitching side doesn&#39;t have a sure-fire ace, but Barnes, Webster, and
Owens all have mid-rotation starter potential, perhaps more. Workman, too.
Light and Johnson provide college arms from the 2012 draft who should follow
the pipeline up. There are numerous bullpen candidates, and high-upside
lottery tickets like Kukuk, Montas and Mercedes should be fun to watch in
Low-A and the New York-Penn League.

Knuckleballer Steven Wright is an interesting case. Impossible to predict how
that will go, but definitely worth watching.

Rebuiding isn&#39;t always fun and Red Sox fans want more tastes of post-season
success as soon as possible. Stay patient as best you can; help is on the way.
