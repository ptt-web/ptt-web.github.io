Triston Casas

Casas is one of the streakier hitters in the Draft class, and he was on fire
while playing for the U.S. National 18-and-under team in international
competition. The corner infielder was the MVP of the World Baseball Softball
Confederation U-18 Baseball World Cup, helping Team USA win a gold medal by
leading the tournament in home runs and RBIs. He was named the WBSC
International Baseball Player of the Year for his efforts. Casas is all about
his bat and the power he can produce with it. In terms of raw pop, he&#39;s up
there with just about anyone in the class, registering high exit velocities
at various times. The only question is whether he&#39;ll make enough contact to
tap into that power consistently, as there are some holes in his swing. He
loves to hit and does have an approach at the plate, something he&#39;ll have to
continue to refine at the next level. While Casas is more agile than you&#39;d
think, plays third base at American Heritage with an arm that was up to 92
mph off the mound, and has worked hard to tone up his body, he will likely be
a first baseman only in the future. How much a team believes Casas will hit
will determine his Draft status and if he is taken early enough to walk away
from the University of Miami.

Nick Decker

The last high school outfielder from New Jersey to make a big Draft splash
was, of course, Mike Trout. Only one prep bat from the Garden State has gone
prior to the fifth round since then (2011 second-rounder Carl Thomore), and
while Decker isn&#39;t projected to make a Trout-like impact, seeing him join
Thomore in this select group isn&#39;t out of the question. Decker isn&#39;t the
toolshed his more famous predecessor is, but he does have one strong carrying
tool: his raw power. It&#39;s legitimate and it shows up presently. He&#39;s very
physical now, without a ton of projection. He&#39;s more power over hit, with
some length to his swing, but he does have good rhythm at the plate, giving
him a better shot of tapping into that strength. Decker will be an average
runner in the future with a decent arm, likely profiling as a left fielder in
the future. Committed to Maryland, Decker fits the corner outfield profile. A
team that believes he&#39;ll hit enough to use that raw pop consistently will be
the one to take him off the board in the top three rounds.

Durbin Feltman

At Oak Ridge High (Conroe, Texas) in 2015, scouts flocked to see two-way star
Luken Baker and barely noticed Feltman, a short right-hander working in the
upper 80s during his first season as a full-time pitcher. They&#39;ve teamed up
in college at Texas Christian, where Baker continues to draw plenty of
interest as a slugger and Feltman has opened eyes as a power-armed closer. He
set a school record and finished second in NCAA Division I with 17 saves as a
sophomore last year, then opened 2018 with 13 straight scoreless outings.
Feltman&#39;s velocity jumped in the spring of his freshman year at TCU and he
now operates at 95-97 mph and peaks at 99 with some running life. His power
slider gives him a second well above-average pitch at times, arriving in the
mid-80s with some depth. He even can mix in a decent changeup on occasion.
Because Feltman lacks size and features effort in his delivery, he&#39;s purely a
reliever. Wiry strong and durable, he has taken a step forward with his
control and command this year. Intelligent and competitive on the mound, he
projects as a possible setup man or closer.
--
Devlin Granberg

Granberg has hit throughout his collegiate career, hitting .427/.508/.680 with
25 home runs in 163 games between Creighton, Cisco Junior College and Dallas
Baptist. But he has never been drafted to this point despite the strong
offensive production. The outfielderhas good hand-eye coordination at the
plate and generates good exit velocity. He can also run for a player of his
size.
--
Nicholas Northcut

One of the better two-way talents   Draft class, Northcut has a fastball that
peaks in the low 90s and a promising breaking ball. He shows even more promise
as a hitter, enough to get selected as early as the third round. Whether that
will be high enough to lure him away from a Vanderbilt commitment remains to
be seen. Northcut&#39;s quick right-handed swing with loft and his strength
combine to generate impressive raw power, which he showed off by finishing
second in the home run derby at the Perfect Game All-American Classic last
August. He lets his pop come naturally and uses the entire field, showing the
potential to hit for average as well. He has a track record of performing well
against top competition on the showcase circuit, starring on the loaded Canes
Baseball travel team. While Northcut is a well below-average runner, he moves
well enough to make plays at third base. His hands and arm strength are
assets, and he could become a solid defender if he can improve his agility.
He&#39;ll have to maintain the conditioning of his thick frame to remain at the
hot corner.
--
Jared Poland

Poland will definitely hit -- he has a compact swing with quick hands and bat
speed -- and the Louisville commit might develop some power, too. The 6-foot,
190-pound second baseman isn&#39;t as good defensively, though, with heavy legs
and footwork in the field. Poland was a Rawlings-Perfect Game Third-Team
All-American for 2018.
--
Zach Watson

Watson&#39;s speed and defense earned him a starting job a month into his 2017
freshman season at Louisiana State. He emerged as the Tigers&#39; most dangerous
hitter during the NCAA postseason, homering five times in 12 games as they
finished runner-up at the College World Series. Despite being bothered by an
oblique strain early this spring, he has continued to shine offensively and
defensively as a Draft-eligible sophomore. Watson&#39;s standout tool is his
plus-plus speed. His quickness and instincts make him one of the best
defensive center fielders in college baseball, reminiscent of but not
quite in the same class as former LSU star Andrew Stevenson. He has
surprising pop and hits line drives that carry out of the park with
regularity. He projects to hit more for average than power but could produce
15 homers per season. He could use more plate discipline to enhance his
ability to get on base, where his quickness makes him a threat to steal.
