Lin controls the strike zone and plays center field better than anyone in the
system, but it&#39;s still uncertain whether he can contribute enough with the bat
to make an impact in the major leagues. Signed for $400000 out of high school
in Taiwan, where he was a national 100-meter and high-jump champion, he has
continued to play for his nation at the 2008 Olympics and 2009 World Baseball
Classic. The Red Sox named him their minor league defensive player of the year
in 2010, when managers rated him the top outfield defender in the Eastern
League. He has plus speed and tremendous instincts in center field, getting
quick jumps and making good reads. Unlike most center fielders, he has a cannon
for an arm and has recorded 33 assists during the last two seasons. He settled
down defensively last year, making just three errors after trying to do too
much at times and committing 11 in 2009. Though Lin is an extremely disciplined
hitter who draws walks and rarely strikes out, his offensive contributions have
been minimal. He has just fair bat speed and a flat swing, so he makes a lot of
soft contact. He had just 23 extra-base hits in 2010 and owns a career .363
slugging percentage. He gets onbase but isn&#39;t an efficient basestealer and
makes mistakes on the basepaths. Until Lin starts driving the ball, it&#39;s
difficult to project him as a big league regular. He&#39;ll advance to Triple-A
at age 22.
