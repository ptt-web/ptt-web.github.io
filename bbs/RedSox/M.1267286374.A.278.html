  Did you know right away that Mike Cameron was your center fielder and
  Ellsbury was going to left?

  Cameron 現在是中外野手，然後 Ellsbury 移去左外野？

  It was a long process in pursuing him and weighing him against other
  alternatives and that was certainly a front-burner issue. Had Cameron
  come right out and said, &#34;I have to play center field for the duration
  of the contract no matter what,&#34; and made it clear it was more about
  him than the team, we probably would have got scared off and gone in
  another direction. He said he would play anywhere. He prefers to play
  center but he&#39;s willing to do whatever it takes to help the team win.
  Jacoby ended up having the same attitude. This is the way we line up
  best now and we knew that the day that we signed Mike, and even Mike
  said that if some point during his tenure here if it&#39;s best for the
  team if Jacoby moves to center and Mike to move to a corner, then
  that&#39;s what he is willing to do if we ask him.

  評估 Cameron 或是其他替代方案無疑是當前最迫切的問題
  Cameron 希望能守中外野，也願意守左外野，只要能幫助球隊獲勝
  Ellsbury 也是同樣的情形



  Did Ellsbury have problems in center last year?

  Ellsbury 去年中外野的守備有問題嗎？

  I think that he is an above-average center fielder now, who is going to
  be a great center fielder. I know there is a certain number we don&#39;t
  use that is accessible to people online that had him as one of the worst
  defensive center fielders in baseball last year. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
  worth anything. I don&#39;t think that number is legitimate. We do our own
  stuff and it showed that he is above average.

  我想他現在是優於平均的的中野手，有些數據認為他是最差的中外野手之一
  我不覺得能代表任何事，也不認為那數據合理，我們的資料顯示他優於平均

  Are there things he still needs to work on in center field? Absolutely.
  Reading the ball off the bat and breaking in on certain balls, that&#39;s
  something he is going to get better at over the years. He&#39;s already
  improved going back on balls and playing balls that are close to the
  wall. He&#39;s going to make those improvements. The only downside I saw to
  the Cameron deal was delaying temporarily Jacoby&#39;s development, but
  taking the big-picture approach, I think he&#39;s going to end up and be a
  really good one and already is.

  還有改善空間嗎？當然，一些球可以處理的更好，但他已進步許多
  唯一的顧慮是在 Cameron 合約期間暫時限制了 Ellsbury 在中外野的發展



  Is the biggest difference between Cameron and Ellsbury the throwing arm?

  Cameron 和 Ellsbury 最大的差別在傳球臂力嗎？

  I think experience more than anything else. Sixteen years of playing
  center field, his instincts are incredible. Mike actually tracks fly
  balls differently than a lot of fielders. Right off the bat he has a
  great feel for where the ball is going to end up and will turn his back
  to the baseball and run to the spot. Just those instincts and getting to
  where he needs to be is something Jacoby is already good at but he&#39;s
  going to get better at with experience.

  經驗的差距。Cameron 有站中外野 16 年的防守經歷，以及不可置信的本能
  Ellsbury 已經不錯，一旦經驗增加他會更好
