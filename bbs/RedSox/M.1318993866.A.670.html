Theo Epstein Rumors: Tuesday
By Tim Dierkes [October 18 at 8:09pm CST]
The latest on the Cubs&#39; attempt to add Red Sox GM Theo Epstein to their front
office...

○The Red Sox are &#34;holding tough&#34; on their asking price and don&#39;t anticipate
resolution tonight, according to Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe (on
Twitter).

○Hoyer told Marty Caswell of XX1090 Sports Radio that he&#39;s not going to
comment
on media speculation (Twitter links).  &#34;I&#39;m excited about what we continue to
build here in San Diego,&#34; he said.

○The Cubs haven&#39;t asked for permission to talk to any Padres executives,
according to Dan Hayes of the North County Times (Twitter link).

○Carrie Muskat of MLB.com points out that obtaining Hoyer could prove
difficult
as he is under contract through 2013 with an option for 2014 (Twitter link).
 But Tom Krasovic of Inside the Padres doubts owner Jeff Moorad would hold up
a
deal if it meant Byrnes became the Padres&#39; next GM (Twitter link).

○Current Padres GM Jed Hoyer is being considered by the Cubs and Epstein,
tweet
SI&#39;s Jon Heyman.  In that scenario, Josh Byrnes would become the Padres&#39; GM.
 Heyman notes that the Cubs are also looking at Padres executives Byrnes and
Jason McLeod for themselves, should Hoyer stay.  All the executives were once
members of the Boston front office with Epstein.

○Yesterday we learned that the Red Sox started out the Epstein compensation
discussions by asking the Cubs for righty Matt Garza, which CSNNE.com&#39;s Sean
McAdam says was &#34;rejected out of hand.&#34;  Nick Cafardo of the Boston Globe says
that &#34;the sides slowly have moved their position to a more realistic center&#34;
as
they discuss Cubs prospects.

○Cafardo says the Red Sox have been focusing on Trey McNutt, Brett Jackson,
Mat
Szczur, and Josh Vitters, the latter three labeled as unlikely by Patrick
Mooney of CSNChicago.com yesterday.  McNutt and Andrew Cashner are unlikely as
well, writes Paul Sullivan of the Chicago Tribune, while McAdam says McNutt&#39;s
inclusion is &#34;far from guaranteed at this point.&#34;

○An announcement today has been ruled out, writes McAdam, with &#34;significant
work&#34; remaining to reach an agreement on compensation.  He says Friday&#39;s World
Series off-day is the earliest possibility, assuming the teams come to terms
and get Bud Selig&#39;s permission for an announcement.  McAdam says that although
progress has been made, the Cubs feel that precedent calls for minimal
compensation while the Sox think this situation defies precedent.

○McAdam writes that the issue of Epstein taking Red Sox employees with him is
not an issue, with a mutual understanding in place that he will not raid
Boston&#39;s baseball operations department.

○Most reports, including this one from Gordon Wittenmyer of the Chicago
Sun-Times, suggest that the five-year, $18.5MM deal between Epstein and the
Cubs is not in jeopardy.  Still, as Cafardo notes, both teams have a lot of
team-building to do.
