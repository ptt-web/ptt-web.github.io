BA的球探報告(三~七輪)

加上Peter Abraham在選秀後的文章

<a href="http://0rz.tw/8nhDc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://0rz.tw/8nhDc</a> by Peter Abraham (三~十輪)

<span class="hl">#081 Jonathan Denney</span>

Denney established himself as a potential first-round pick with his
performance on the showcase circuit last summer, highlighted by a 431-foot
homer at the Area Code Games and a 2-for-3 day with a double at the Under
Armour All-American Game. Denney&#39;s calling card is his righthanded power,
which he generates with quality bat speed and strength. He may have to tone
down his aggressive approach when he faces better pitching in college (he&#39;s
an Arkansas recruit) or pro ball, however. The 6-foot-2, 205-pounder should
provide enough offense to profile at first base if he can&#39;t stick at catcher,
but that shouldn&#39;t be an issue. Denney has solid arm strength, though he
needs to refine his footwork to get the most out of his throws. He has the
hands to be an effective receiver and moves well behind the plate. Denney&#39;s
bat speed and stock were down a little, but he still has a good chance to
become just the second Oklahoma high school catcher taken in the first round,
after Darrell Porter was the No. 4 overall choice in 1970.

<span class="f1 hl">Jonathan Denney在去年夏天的表現一舉讓他有機會成為第一輪的球員─尤其是Area Code</span>
<span class="f1 hl">Games中的431呎全壘打和Under Armour All-American Game中2-3(含一支二壘安打)的表現</span>
<span class="f1 hl">相當亮眼。Denney最有看頭的部份是右打時的砲瓦，他能展現出不錯的揮棒速度和力量。</span>

<span class="f1 hl">不過當他在面對更高階(大學或職業棒球)的球路時他可能得降低過盛的攻擊欲望。這位6呎</span>
<span class="f1 hl">2吋、205磅就算無法勝任捕手也能靠棒子在一壘活下去，不過這應該不會是問題─他的手</span>
<span class="f1 hl">臂有不錯的力量，只是在傳球時的腳步需要再調整一下。Denney的手能讓他成為很不錯的</span>
<span class="f1 hl">接球手。</span>

<span class="f1 hl">Denney的揮棒速度和價值有點下降，不過他有希望成為Oklahoma史上第二位第一輪的高中</span>
<span class="f1 hl">捕手。(第一位是1970的Darrell Porter，第四順位。)</span>

<span class="b1 hl">Peter Abraham</span>

Denney was generally listed as a player worthy of a late first-round or
second-round pick. So the Red Sox appear to have done well by selecting him
with the 81st overall pick.

<span class="f1 hl">Denney被歸類為有希望成為首輪末段或是第二輪的球員，所以紅襪這一票幹的漂亮。</span>

Denney was considered a tough player to sign because of a commitment to play
at Arkansas. But Denney wrote this on Twitter a short time ago: &#34;I&#39;m so happy
to be an official Red Sox baseball player in their organization thank you
friends and family for the support!&#34;

That was followed by: &#34;This is awesome I have been a Red Sox fan my whole
life! Ever since I started watching MLB baseball, now I&#39;m a part of their
organization!&#34;

<span class="f1 hl">大家認為Denney要去讀Arkansas所以會很難簽，但是</span>

<span class="f6 hl">I&#39;m so happy to be an official Red Sox baseball player in their organization </span>
<span class="f6 hl">thank you friends and family for the support!</span>

<span class="hl">很高興正式成為紅襪球員，感謝朋友和家人的支持！</span>

<span class="f6 hl">What&#39;s funny is the whole world knew I was selected by the Red Sox like a </span>
<span class="f6 hl">hour before I knew... <a href="/bbs/RedSox/G.835393843.A.BE4.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#beenonapla</a>ne <a href="/bbs/RedSox/G.3838787383.A.AF2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#sohappytho</a>ugh</span>

<span class="hl">有趣的是全世界都比我早一個小時知道我被紅襪選中了。 #我在飛機上 #總之我很開心</span>

<a href="https://twitter.com/jondenney26/status/343078536476782592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://twitter.com/jondenney26/status/343078536476782592</a>

<span class="f6 hl">This is awesome i have been a Red Sox fan my whole life! Ever since I started </span>
<span class="f6 hl">watching MLB baseball, now I&#39;m apart of their organization!</span>

<span class="hl">打從看MLB開始我就是紅襪迷！現在我成為紅襪的一部份啦！</span>

That certainly sounds like he has a deal in place.

<span class="f1 hl">所以你說呢lol</span>

The Red Sox are well-stocked with catchers (Ryan Lavanway, Christian Vazquez,
Blake Swihart), but is a position where depth never seems to last. Denney has
the bat that would allow him to play first base.

<span class="f1 hl">雖然紅襪囤了一大票好捕手(Ryan Lavanway, Christian Vazquez, Blake Swihart)不過</span>
<span class="f1 hl">捕手總是不嫌少的。Denney的棒子也能讓他勝任一壘手。</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="hl">#113 Myles Smith</span>

Smith has a chance to be the Corey Black of 2013. Black was an undersized
righthander whom the Yankees drafted in the fourth round out of NAIA Faulkner
(Ala.) in 2012, after he transferred from Division I San Diego State. A
Detroit native, Smith began his career at Missouri, occasionally hitting the
low 90s as a freshman reliever in 2011. He transferred to Miami Dade JC last
season and ran his fastball up to 94 mph to go with a good changeup, and the
Mets drafted him in the 16th round. Smith didn&#39;t sign and expected to
transfer to Miami, but he wound up at Lee (Tenn.), an NAIA power. The
6-foot-1, 170-pounder had a dominant season (11-3, 1.51) and has improved
since junior college. Smith&#39;s breaking ball remains his third pitch, but when
he throws it harder it morphs into a useful cutter, scraping the upper 80s.
His velocity is more consistently in the 91-95 mph range this spring,
touching 97, and the changeup is a plus pitch with late fade. Smith has a
chance to go out in the first three rounds.

<span class="f6 hl">Smith有機會成為2013年版的Corey Black─Black是洋基第四輪選中的小隻右投。來自底</span>
<span class="f6 hl">特律的Smith在Missouri開始了生涯，一年級擔任牛棚時偶爾能飆到low-90s，去年轉到</span>
<span class="f6 hl">Miami Dade JC之後直球能飆到94 mph，也有很棒的changeup。大都會去年以第16輪選進</span>
<span class="f6 hl">Smith，不過他並未簽約。原本以為他會轉去Miami，但他最後去了田納西的Lee。這位6呎</span>
<span class="f6 hl">1吋、170磅的投手繳出很棒的球季(11-3, 1.51)，這一年以來也有進步。Smith的breaking</span>
<span class="f6 hl">ball還是他的第三球種，不過當他用力一點投的時候就能變成很有效的cutter(upper 80s)</span>
<span class="f6 hl">。他在今年春天的球速大致落在91~95mph，最高97mph；changeup是他的優秀球種，帶有</span>
<span class="f6 hl">尾勁。Smith有望打進前三輪。</span>

<span class="b1 hl">Peter Abraham</span>

Smith, a Detroit native, has bounced around in his career. He started out at
Missouri then switched to Miami-Dade Junior College before landing at Lee, a
NAIA school.

<span class="f6 hl">到處漂泊的Smith來自底特律，先後呆過、Miami-Dade Junior College和Lee。</span>

At 6-foot-1, he is smaller than the usual righthanders the Red Sox select.
But he throws in the mid-90s according to Baseball America and had a terrific
season for Lee (11-3, 1.51 ERA).

<span class="f6 hl">身高6呎1吋，比紅襪通常會選的右投手還矮。不過他能丟到mid-90s，今年球季的成績也</span>
<span class="f6 hl">很不錯(11-3, 1.51 ERA)。</span>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="hl">#143 Corey Littrell</span>

Littrell moved into a weekend starting role as a Kentucky freshman three
years ago, a tribute to his competitiveness and tremendous feel for pitching.
The 6-foot-3, 195-pounder usually operates at 89-90 mph with his fastball and
maxes out at 92, locating it to both sides of the plate. Some scouts say his
changeup is his best pitch, while others point to his newly added cutter,
which is tough on lefties. He also can spin a curveball for early-count
strikes. Littrell can get wild at times, and his delivery is a little stiff
and features a minor wrist wrap in the back, but he still projects as a
starter. He has good bloodlines, as his grandfather Jack was a big league
infielder and his father was a pitcher who signed with the Dodgers as an
11th-round pick in 1977. Corey was a Nationals 43rd-rounder as a Kentucky
high schooler in 2010.

<span class="f4 hl">三年前還是大一的Littrell成為週末的先發投手，因為他很有競爭力，對於投球也很有感</span>
<span class="f4 hl">覺。這位6呎3吋、195磅左投的直球大致在89-90mph左右(最高92mph)，內外角都能投。有</span>
<span class="f4 hl">些球探認為他的最佳球種是changeup，不過有些球探則認為他新練的cutter比較強，能壓</span>
<span class="f4 hl">制左打者。他也有能率先搶下好球數的曲球。但他有時會爆走，投球姿勢有些僵硬，尤其</span>
<span class="f4 hl">是a minor wrist wrap in the back</span><span class="f2 hl">(這句不太懂)</span><span class="f4 hl">，不過他的未來藍圖還是成為先發投手</span>
<span class="f4 hl">。他的血統很棒，祖父Jack Littrell是大聯盟內野手，父親是道奇在1977年時第11輪的</span>
<span class="f4 hl">投手。2010年、CoreyLittrell還是高中生時國民曾用第43輪籤選他。</span>

<span class="b1 hl">Peter Abraham</span>

Littrell had a good summer with Harwich in the Cape Cod League. He does not
have overwhelming stuff, but a polished major college lefthander certainly
has value to an organization.

<span class="f4 hl">Littrell在夏天的表現很棒。他或許沒有很驚人的stuff，他是一個有些完成度的大學左</span>
<span class="f4 hl">投，所以對紅襪多少有幫助。</span>

His father, righthander Jack Littrell Jr., pitched in the Los Angeles Dodgers
(1977-78) and Montreal Expos (1980) organizations. Grandfather, Jack Littrell
Sr., appeared in 111 big league games as an infielder for the Philadelphia
Athletics (1952, 1954), Kansas City Athletics (1955), and Chicago Cubs (1957).

<span class="f4 hl">他的父親Jack Littrell Jr.是右投手，曾效力過過道奇(1977-1978)和博覽會(1980)；</span>
<span class="f4 hl">祖父Jack Littrell Sr.則是內野手，打過111場比賽。</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="hl">#173 Jordon Austin</span>

Austin has a physical frame that reminds some scouts of Ron Gant with his
short body and current strength. He has average speed an athleticism, and
teams that are in on him are buying the power potential.

<span class="f2 hl">Austin有著運動員的身材，讓球探們聯想到Ron Grant那短小但充滿已經力量的身材。他</span>
<span class="f2 hl">的跑步速度一般，有不錯的運動能力。看上他的球隊幾乎是想要他的砲瓦潛力。</span>

<span class="b1 hl">Peter Abraham</span>

He is 6-foot, 195 pounds and also played football well enough in high school
to merit scholarship offers as a linebacker or safety. Jordon runs a 4.4
40-yard dash according to media coverage of his high school career.

<span class="f2 hl">6呎、195磅的Austin在高中時期很會打美式足球(linebacker或safety)，足以讓他拿下獎</span>
<span class="f2 hl">學金。高中時他的40碼衝刺大約4.4秒。</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="hl">#203 Mike Adams</span>

Adams emerged as Tampa&#39;s &#34;moment of truth&#34; reliever this season, but he got
hammered in regional play, a potential sign he was wearing down under a heavy
workload. He ranked second on the team with 56 innings despite making only
one start. The 6-foot-3, 215-pounder repeats his delivery well, helping him
throw quality strikes at his best with two above-average pitches. Adams sits
87-91 mph with his fastball and has good life on the pitch, then commands his
above-average curve, allowing him bury it or throw it in the strike zone.

<span class="f5 hl">Adams在這季成為Tampa的&#34;moment of truth&#34;型的牛棚投手，但是再區域比賽時被打爆─</span>
<span class="f5 hl">應該是操勞過度後的虛脫現象。他再對上的工作量排名第二，但是他只有先發過一次。這</span>
<span class="f5 hl">位6呎3吋、215磅的投手很能重複投球動作，所以能用兩個above-average的球種投出不錯</span>
<span class="f5 hl">的好球訴求大約87-91mph，很有尾勁；很會控曲球，可以丟進好球帶或是讓球溜到好球帶</span>
<span class="f5 hl">之下。</span>

<span class="b1 hl">Peter Abraham</span>

A reliever for the Division 2 power, Adams may be viewed as a fresh arm who
can made into a starter. He throws a good curveball according to scouting
reports.

<span class="f5 hl">Division 2的牛棚投手，新鮮手幣或許有希望能養成先發。他的曲球很不錯。</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="b1 hl">以下都是出自Peter Abraham的文章</span>

<span class="hl">#233 Forrestt Allday</span>

He averaged 1.04 walks her game, third nationally. That led to a .486 OBP. He
is a senior with junior eligibility.

<span class="f3 hl">場均1.04保送，全國第三；上壘率.486。他是擁有大三資格的大四生。</span>


<span class="hl">#263 Kyle Martin</span>

He&#39;s a senior who didn&#39;t have a very good season (3-4, 4.91) as a reliever and
occasional starter. He is 6-foot-7, 220 pounds so their scouts must see
physical tools that can be polished.

<span class="f2 hl">本季表現不佳的大四牛棚投手(3-4, 4.91)。他偶爾會頂替先發工作。Martin 6呎7吋、220</span>
<span class="f2 hl">磅身材，球探認為他的體能條件讓他有可以磨練的空間。</span>

<span class="hl">#293 Taylor Grover</span>  <a href="http://0rz.tw/tiKBN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://0rz.tw/tiKBN</a>  (Abraham沒說啥，引自SoxProscpects)

Grover was the team&#39;s &#34;ace reliever&#34; this season, according to The Augusta
Chronicle. A junior, the righty compiled a 5-0 record this season to go along
with a 0.92 ERA over 29 1/3 innings in 31 appearances. He struck out 37,
while walking 14, and was named a Division II Third-Team All-American. He
earned 11 saves, which led the Peach Belt Conference and was 10th-highest
total in the nation, according to the school&#39;s website.

<span class="f1 hl">6呎3吋、195磅的王牌RP，入選Division II的年度第三隊。(成績如上)</span>

***

The Sox closed the first day of the draft with four consecutive seniors.
That was similar to the strategy they employed last season. Because seniors
have no negotiating leverage, they can be signed below their slot value and
the money saved can go to better prospects.

<span class="f5 hl">紅襪最後連選四個大四生，跟去年的策略一致。大四生，你還能抱怨錢太少嗎？乖乖吞低</span>
<span class="f5 hl">薪，球團要把錢花在好的新秀上！</span>

Denney, in particular, could be the player who benefits from this.
