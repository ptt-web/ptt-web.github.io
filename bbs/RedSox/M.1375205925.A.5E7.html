Bogaerts played his fifth game at third base Monday night, continuing to
impress at the position. (&#34;Very much like [Iglesias], they&#39;re such good
athletes … It&#39;s more just getting them used to an angle,&#34; said Pawtucket
manager Gary DiSarcina Friday. &#34;I would be more nervous putting Bogie at
second. He&#39;s played [five] games over there and he&#39;s done pretty well.&#34;)

<span class="f6 hl">昨天是本季第五度鎮守三壘，結果還是很不錯。DiSarcina：「他跟Iglesias差不多，都是</span>
<span class="f6 hl">很棒的運動員，只是需要適應不同的(守備)角度。他守三壘還蠻不錯的，比把他放二壘更</span>
<span class="f6 hl">讓我安心。」</span>

After collecting two more hits Monday night, Bogaerts is hitting .279 with an
.863 OPS since his mid-year promotion to Pawtucket. In his last 10 games, the
righty hitter has a .361 batting average and 1.048 OPS. He&#39;s reached base in
26 straight games since June 29, hitting .326 with a .439 OBP, .528 slugging
mark and more walks (17) than strikeouts (15) in that stretch.

<span class="f6 hl">升上Paw Sox後打擊率.279，OPS高達.863；近十戰則分別為.361和1.048。他在六月29日</span>
<span class="f6 hl">之後連續26場上壘，.326/.439/.528/.967，17保送、15三振。</span>

Meanwhile, he seems to maturing -- both physically and mentally -- at an
extremely rapid pace.

<span class="f6 hl">感覺身心都很成熟，已經在前往大聯盟的快速道路上了。</span>

&#34;I&#39;m enjoying him while I have him,&#34; DiSarcina said. &#34;He has a lot to learn.
He has a lot to learn in many phases of the game. It&#39;s not just hitting. But
he&#39;s capable of doing it. He&#39;s going to be an impact player, no doubt. It&#39;s
just a matter of time.&#34;

<span class="f6 hl">「有他真棒。」DiSarcina表示：「他有很多比賽的東西要學，不只是打擊─但他就是有</span>
<span class="f6 hl">辦法做到。他未來一定會成為有影響力的選手，只是時間早晚的問題。」</span>

But, as Farrell hinted at when asked about the 20-year-old prior to Monday
night&#39;s game against the Rays, there is still work to be done. And while the
Red Sox could call up Bogaerts and try to catch lightning in a bottle for the
stretch drive, a pennant race isn&#39;t exactly the ideal place to be uncovering
what it takes to be a major-leaguer.

<span class="f6 hl">不過Farrell在昨天暗示Bogaerts還有需要加強的地方，雖然紅襪可以冒險拉她上來，但</span>
<span class="f6 hl">是在與光芒打名次戰的狀態下，不是個適合揭曉升Bogaerts代價為何的好時機。</span>

As DiSarcina pointed out, Bogaerts is moving fast down the road towards the
big leagues, but there is still plenty of pavement to go.

<span class="f6 hl">雖然DiSarcina表示Bogaerts進度快速，但是還有一段路要走。</span>

&#34;Being with him on a daily basis I see all the warts, I see the immaturity, I
see the greenness,&#34; the PawSox manager said. &#34;I see the things he does in a
game you don&#39;t see in a box score.

<span class="f6 hl">DiSarcina：「天天盯著他就會看出一些東西，我看到了一些不成熟度。我能看見Box裡看</span>
<span class="f6 hl">不見的東西。」</span>

&#34;It&#39;s hard to quantify when he&#39;s going to be ready, or say, &#39;He just needs
one more week of seasoning,&#39; because the needs of a ball club call. I saw
 [Mike] Trout for 45 games in Double-A and the big leagued hadn&#39;t called him
up yet until Peter Bourjos pulled a hamstring. It&#39;s so random. It&#39;s hard to
say whose time schedule your on.&#34;

<span class="f6 hl">「很難量化出球員什麼時候能準備好，或是說因為球團需求『他只要喬一星期就好』。</span>
<span class="f6 hl">我在AA看Mike Trout打了45場比賽，那時Peter Bourjos大腿拉傷依然沒有拉Trout上去。</span>
<span class="f6 hl">我們很難在時間表上勾出時間。」</span>

Some of Bogaerts&#39; areas for improvement are tangible for the Red Sox, but
easily corrected. For instance, when the shortstop lost a ball in the sun
because he failed to secure a pair of sunglasses, costing his starting
pitcher 20 additional tosses, it didn&#39;t take long to make him understand the
importance of bringing along the correct equipment.

<span class="f6 hl">有些改進空間很明顯但也很容易修正，例如之前Bogaerts因為無法戴好太陽眼鏡而漏球，</span>
<span class="f6 hl">讓先發投手多投20球，很快的Bogaerts就知道他該準備好適當的裝備。</span>

While his defense isn&#39;t refined, what he currently delivers seems certainly
good enough for now.

<span class="f6 hl">雖然防守部分還沒完成，不過目前為止的表現還算不錯。</span>

&#34;He&#39;s not your typical, fundamental Alan Trammell, or Mike Bordick or Omar
Vizquel, fundamental shortstop,&#34; DiSarcina said. &#34;He&#39;s not a wide-based,
over-the-top throwing shortstop. He does things a little bit unconventional.
He does things a little bit unconventional, but he fields the ball properly
and when he does he does two or three things that really allow him to catch
the ball. He has great hand-eye coordination. He has great glove
presentation. When that ball comes to him his glove is wide open. And he has
really strong hands. For me, it&#39;s irrelevant for me to say he can play
shortstop in the big leagues. He&#39;s making the plays. It doesn&#39;t have to be
pretty.

<span class="f6 hl">DiSarcina：「他不是理想型的游擊手，例如Alan Trammell、Mike Bordick或Omar Vizquel</span>
<span class="f6 hl">那些底盤厚、高壓傳球的游擊。他的作法比較不正統，但是他都能『適當的』守下球，有</span>
<span class="f6 hl">時他會藉由兩三個撇步讓他接到球。」</span>

<span class="f6 hl">「他的手眼協調很棒，手套的擺放很優。球向他去時手套整個張開，而且他也有很有力的</span>
<span class="f6 hl">手。我不該斷言他能在大聯盟站穩游擊，但是只要能守下來，管他漂不漂亮。」</span>

&#34;You think two or three years down the road and think about how big this kid
is going to be, because he does look bigger every week I see him.&#34;

<span class="f6 hl">「想想他兩三年後會變多大隻，我覺得他根本是一週比一週大。」</span>

But there are a few intricacies that major league teams could quickly
identify, sending both Bogaerts and the Red Sox down an uncomfortable road
for the final few months.

<span class="f6 hl">不過有些細節會讓Bogaerts跟紅襪在接下來幾個月感到不適應。</span>

DiSarcina offers some examples:

<span class="f6 hl">DiSarcina舉了一些例子：</span>

<span class="b5 hl">Baserunning:</span> &#34;For me, he has to work on his baserunning. He needs to get
better leads. He needs to be more in-tune with things. It&#39;s not because he&#39;s
not paying attention. He&#39;s 20 years old. Just the little things, like picking
up signs right away. Having secondary leads. What Bogie missed was that time
up in spring training with [manager John Farrell], [bench coach Torey
Lovullo] and [third base coach Brian Butterfield], how important they
stressed it. We had four stations on four different days with Butter going
through every situation, the stressing of the fundamentals of baserunning …
 he missed it. He&#39;s behind, in my opinion. So it&#39;s my job down here to kind
of catch him up and give him bits and pieces down here.&#34;

<span class="b5 hl">跑壘</span>

<span class="f5 hl">「Bogaerts的跑壘需要加強，必須跟上比賽─並不是不專心的問題，而像是無法立即解讀</span>
<span class="f5 hl">暗號。另外還有Bogaerts錯過春訓，錯過給Farrell、Lovullo和Butterfield帶的時間。</span>
<span class="f5 hl">春訓中有四天在講述不同狀況以及跑壘的基礎要點，Bogaerts錯過了。我認為他在這個部</span>
<span class="f5 hl">份落後了，而我的工作就是要讓他趕上進度。」</span>

<span class="b6 hl">Infield play:</span> &#34;One of the things he needs to do a little bit better are on
cuts and relays. He&#39;s not there yet. When a man is on first and a ball is hit
in the right-center field gap, he has to think where he&#39;s going to go. You
can see he thinks and then reacts. That&#39;s just reps. He&#39;s flown through the
system here.&#34;

<span class="b6 hl">內野守備</span>

<span class="f6 hl">「攔截和轉傳還不到位。一壘有人球打到右外野空檔時，他該想他要怎麼做。你可以看到</span>
<span class="f6 hl">他先想過再反應。」</span>

<span class="b1 hl">Hitting:</span> &#34;He&#39;s like any young kid, he tries to stay inside everything. They
get up here and the inner-third becomes exposed. We saw it with [Jackie
Bradley Jr.] earlier in the year, &#39;Oh my goodness, there&#39;s an inner-third of
the plate?&#39; You have to start pulling, but pulling the right way. Xander&#39;s
not there yet. He hasn&#39;t hit a ball hard down the third-base line, or hard in
the hole yet. All of his balls, and especially his home run balls, have been
from left-center to the right-field foul pole. That takes time. He hasn&#39;t
learned that bat path yet.&#34;

<span class="b1 hl">打擊</span>

<span class="f1 hl">「跟其他小孩一樣，很喜歡stay inside。Jackie Bradley Jr.之前也是，內角高變成大</span>
<span class="f1 hl">弱點─『喔？原來有這個地方喔』，你必須開始拉打─而且是往正確的方向拉。Bogaerts</span>
<span class="f1 hl">也是沒到位，不大有車三壘線或是三游間的強襲球。他打出去的球─尤其是全壘打，都是</span>
<span class="f1 hl">中左外野到右側標竿之間。這需要時間練習，他還沒有掌握到這個揮棒軌跡。」</span>

Bogaerts is figuring it out, but the Red Sox are also intent on him
continuing the process in the right setting. If they get Young, the decision
on where that learning curve continues is a no-brainer. If not? A leap of
faith might be in the works.

<span class="f6 hl">Bogaerts正在破繭而出，不過紅襪目前傾向讓他待在正確環境訓練。如果有買到Young，</span>
<span class="f6 hl">那就不用管Bogaerts的學習取限進展到哪裡；反之則需要很強的信念囉。</span>

&#34;I think he&#39;s a quick learner, but it has to be small steps. You can&#39;t
force-feed him a lot,&#34; DiSarcina said. &#34;What he&#39;s really good at is he asked
questions. Everyone learns differently. Some are verbals. Some are visual.
For him, it&#39;s feeling it and going through it.&#34;

<span class="f6 hl">DiSarcina：「他是個很棒的學習者，但是都必須慢慢來─你不能強灌。他最棒的地方是</span>
<span class="f6 hl">他會問問題。大家的學習方式都不同，有些是口頭上的，有些是視覺上的學習。Bogaerts</span>
<span class="f6 hl">呢，則是感覺它然後克服它。」</span>

說到Young...

<a href="https://twitter.com/nickcafardo/status/362260440648126465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://twitter.com/nickcafardo/status/362260440648126465</a>

Asked one GM if he was getting Young he said &#34;no just getting older.&#34;

Ah that trade deadline humor.

XDDDDDDDDD
