<span class="f3 b1 hl">Boston Red Sox: Why Clay Buchholz Can Continue His Outstanding Production</span>

<a href="http://0rz.tw/BCOws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://0rz.tw/BCOws</a>  by Andrew Martin

Boston Red Sox starter Clay Buchholz has jumped out to arguably the best
start of any pitcher in baseball this season. While it is unlikely he will
keep up his current torrid pace, signs indicate that he can continue
contributing outstanding production.

<span class="f6 hl">現在八釦子可以說是本季以來表現最好的投手。雖然他不太可能一直維持這種高檔表現，</span>
<span class="f6 hl">但是跡象顯示他還是能提供很棒的表現。</span>

The 28-year-old right-hander is off to the finest start of his career, having
posted a 5-0 record and 1.19 ERA in his first five starts. In 37.2 innings,
he has allowed just 25 hits, while striking out 39 and walking 13.
Additionally, he has gone at least seven innings in each of his starts, while
giving up two or fewer runs each time.

<span class="f6 hl">目前5-0、1.19 ERA、37.2 IP (5GS)只被打25支安打，39次三振、13次保送─是他生涯最</span>
<span class="f6 hl">棒的開季。而且他在五場比賽中都投超過七局，每一場的失分都不超過兩分。</span>

Pitching in his seventh major league season, he is 51-32 with a 3.77 ERA in
112 career games (110 starts), but has struggled with health and
inconsistency. The only two seasons he had as many as 16 starts in his
previous six years in Boston came in 2010 (28 starts) and 2012 (29 starts).

<span class="f6 hl">八釦子在大聯盟的七季一共繳出51-32、3.77 ERA(112G、110GS)，但長期受傷並與穩定性</span>
<span class="f6 hl">不足所苦。他在紅襪的近六個球季中只有兩次單季先發場次超過16場，分別是2010年(28</span>
<span class="f6 hl">場)和2012年(29場)。</span>

The Providence Journal’s Tim Britton explained in a couple of tweets why
what Buchholz is doing this year has been both rare and historic:

<span class="f6 hl">Tim Britton指出八釦子今年的表現有多麼特別：</span>

       Clay Buchholz is the first MLB starter in 11 years to go at least
       seven innings with 2ER or fewer in his first five starts of the
       season.

      <span class="f1 hl"> 八釦子是大聯盟近11年以來首位開季五場先發都超過七局並不超過2 ER的投手。</span>

       Buchholz done. He&#39;s the first Red Sox starter to go at least seven in
       his first five starts since Pedro in 2000.

       <span class="f1 hl">上次開季五場先發都超過七局的紅襪投手是Pedro Martinez (2000)。</span>

Few pitchers have or ever will match Martinez’s production with the Red Sox
(117-37, 2.52 ERA in seven seasons). However, Buchholz has become a very
solid starter and there are a number of reasons suggesting why he will
continue building upon his outstanding start to the 2013 season.

<span class="f6 hl">很少人能追上Pedro (117-37, 2.52 ERA in seven seasons)。不過八釦子是不錯的先發</span>
<span class="f6 hl">投手，也有一些數據顯示他能繼續拿出好表現。</span>

With a caveat that five games is a small sample size, FanGraphs.com’s data
suggests that Buchholz may have harnessed his stuff and matured into a better
pitcher.

<span class="f6 hl">五場比賽只是小樣本，不過FanGraphs.com顯示八釦子成功的運用他的stuff，成為一位更</span>
<span class="f6 hl">棒的投手。</span>

His average fastball velocity of 91.6 mph is the lowest of his career.
Despite the loss of speed, his vFA/C (Fastball Runs Above Average per 100
pitches) of 0.97 is his highest since 2010 when it was 1.14. In addition, his
Runs Above Average per 100 pitches value on his cutter (4.04), curveball
(2.28) and changeup (2.31) are the highest of his career.

<span class="f6 hl">他的直球均速是生涯最低的91.6mph，但是他的wFA/C(Fastball Runs Above Average per </span>
<span class="f6 hl">100 pitches，每一百球省下的分數，評斷該球種之價值)是1.20</span><span class="f2">(有更新了)</span><span class="f6 hl">，2010年是</span>
<span class="f6 hl">1.14。其他球種也都是生涯最棒，cutter (4.04), curveball (2.28)和changeup (2.31)。</span>

His 9.3 strikeouts, 6.0 hits and 0.2 home runs allowed per nine innings
represent career bests, while he has surpassed the 3.0 walks he has allowed
per nine innings this year just once before.

<span class="f6 hl">他的每九局6.3K、6H、0,2HR也都是生涯最高，3.0次保送是第二好(只比去年高)。</span>

Combining those statistics with his pitch values and the fact he has no
significant changes in how frequently he has thrown his various pitches
provides solid proof he is commanding his stuff better than ever.

<span class="f6 hl">而數據同時顯示他的球種比例並無大幅改變，這證明了他的控球有進步。</span>

The Boston Globe’s Nick Cafardo reported that Boston manager John Farrell
and pitching coach Juan Nieves mandated Red Sox pitchers, especially
Buchholz, pick up the pace between pitches this season. This was to not only
to keep hitters off-balance, but to also prevent the pitchers from thinking
too much.

<span class="f6 hl">據Nick Cafardo表示，John Farrell和Juan Nieves要求投手─尤其是八釦子─要讓每次</span>
<span class="f6 hl">投球之間的間隔縮短。除了讓打者適應不過來外，還能避免投手想太多。</span>

It appears Buchholz has succeeded in adopting that approach. FanGraphs.com
shows that he is averaging 23.3 seconds between pitches, which is the best
mark of his career and nearly two and a half seconds better than last year’s
mark of 25.6.

<span class="f6 hl">顯然八釦子已經適應了這個調整。FanGraphs.com顯示他今年的投球間隔只有23.3秒，是</span>
<span class="f6 hl">生涯最短─比去年的25.6秒少了整整2.3秒。</span>

Looking at his BABIP (Batting Average on Balls in Play) counters any argument
that his success has been due to luck. The .264 average he’s allowed this
year is right in line with his career mark of .281. It is also nearly
identical to the .261 he permitted in 2010, when he had his best season as a
major leaguer, going 17-7 with a 2.33 ERA.

<span class="f6 hl">有些人說這只是運氣好，但是他的BABIP並不是這麼說的。本季.264、生涯平均是不遠的</span>
<span class="f6 hl">.281，2010年更是相當接近的.261，該年他拿出17-7、2.33 ERA的超優表現。</span>


Buchholz has also maintained his success when working with different catchers.

<span class="f6 hl">他搭配不同捕手照樣能拿好表現。</span>

BaseballReference.com shows he has a 1.14 ERA when caught by starter Jarrod
Saltalamacchia, and a 1.29 ERA when David Ross, who is considered a much
better defender, is his receiver.

<span class="f6 hl">BaseballReference.com顯示八釦子搭配Salty時1.14 ERA；搭配蹲捕能力更優David Ross</span>
<span class="f6 hl">則是1.29 ERA。</span>

Buchholz’s dominance has come against diverse competition. Four of his five
starts have come at home. He has also faced three teams with winning records,
including the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles, who both rank in the
top four in runs per game in the American League.

<span class="f6 hl">他的對手也很不同，五次先發有四次是在主場，但是有三支球隊勝率過五成，也有場均得</span>
<span class="f6 hl">分前四的洋基和金鶯。</span>

It’s highly unlikely that Buchholz will finish with a 1.19 ERA. However, if
he remains consistent in the various improvements he appears to have made,
there’s no reason why he won’t be one of the best pitchers in baseball at
the end of the 2013 season.

<span class="f6 hl">八釦子不太可能會繳出整季1.19 ERA的成績，但如果他保持他進步之處的穩定性的話，他</span>
<span class="f6 hl">會成為2013年球季中最棒的投手之一。</span>
