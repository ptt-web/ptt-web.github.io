<span class="f1 hl">Catcher</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Luis Exposito (A+)</span>
<span class="f3 hl">Mark Wagner (AA)</span>
<span class="f4 hl">Dusty Brown (AAA)</span>
<span class="f4 hl">George Kottaras (AAA)</span>
Ryan Lavarnway (shortseason)

Catcher&#39;s a weak position in our organization. Brown and Kottaras both look
like backup catchers in the big leagues, while Wagner got the defense to be a
starter but needs to learn how to hit. The only one I really like is Exposito.
He&#39;s already a great defender, and his offense is finally there this year.
Lavarnway was a 6th rounder from Yale this year, and he had a .398 average
there, so he&#39;s got good offense but he&#39;s really raw defensively.

<span class="f1 hl">First Base</span>
<span class="f3 hl">Lars Anderson (A+/AA)</span>
<span class="f3 hl">Aaron Bates (AA)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Mike Jones (A+)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Anthony Rizzo (A-)</span>

We&#39;re really top heavy at first. Lars Anderson looks like a potential 30+
homer, 100+ RBI guy, but besides him we don&#39;t have much. Bates looked real good
last year, but this year he&#39;s really tailed off. Mike Jones has looked terrific
in Lancaster and Greenville to the tune of .318/.391/.456, but it&#39;s Lancaster,
so you really can&#39;t take much from it. He&#39;s a real unknown right nowI loved
Rizzo earlier in the season, but he was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#39;s Lymphoma in
May. He&#39;s supposed to recover from it, but cancer is definitely a major
obstacle.

<span class="f1 hl">Second Base</span>
Dustin Pedroia (MLB)
Ryan Dent (short season)
<span class="f2 hl">Chih-Hsien Chiang (A+)</span>
<span class="f4 hl">Joe Thurston (AAA)</span>

That&#39;s really it for second. Pedroia&#39;s awesome, already with a ROY and an All
Star appearance on his resume. He&#39;ll be playing there for the next 5-10 years
for the Sox. Dent was a high pick for the Sox, and he&#39;s shown tools and speed,
but he&#39;s really struggled for Lowell. Hopefully he&#39;ll figure it out. Chiang is
looking really good offensively in Lancaster, and I think he could become a
major league 2B, but he really needs work on his defense. Thurston&#39;s 28, but I
thought I needed to put him on here. He is a FOUR time AAA All Star, which is
very impressive, and is having a good season, but at best he&#39;ll be a utility
guy in the majors.

<span class="f1 hl">Third Base</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Michael Almanzar (A-)</span>
Will Middlebrooks (short season)

Almanzar is still really raw, but he is looking like a future superstar right
now. He really excelled in the rookie league earlier in the year, and he&#39;s held
his own in low-A as a 17 year old. He&#39;s looking like something special.
Middlebrooks has a lot of great tools, a cannon arm at third, contact skills
and power, but he still is struggling. He&#39;s highly regarded by the Sox, though,
so hopefully he can figure it out.

<span class="f1 hl">Shortstop</span>
Jed Lowrie (AAA/MLB)
<span class="f3 hl">Argenis Diaz (AA)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Yamaico Navarro (A+)</span>
Casey Kelly (rookie)

Lowrie&#39;s offensively looking a ton better than Lugo in Boston right now, and he
should become the shortstop for Boston next year. The only concerns with him
are defense, but he&#39;s done quite well so far and should stick at shortstop.
Diaz is an amazing defender with amazing range, a terrific arm, and a great
glove. His offense isn&#39;t in the same league as his defense, but he does have
good contact skills. Navarro is a line drive hitter with good power. He plays
many positions, but shortstop is his main position. Could become a good
shortstop or utilityman in the majors. Kelly has the potential to be a 20 homer
shortstop on the big league level, but the Sox see his future in pitching,
where he was seen as the most projectable pitcher in the draft by them.

<span class="f1 hl">Outfield</span>
Jacoby Ellsbury (MLB)
<span class="f3 hl">Josh Reddick (AA)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Che-Hsuan LIn (A-)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Ryan Kalish (A-)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Jason Place (A+)</span>
<span class="f4 hl">Chris Carter (AAA)</span>

Ellsbury is a speedster on the basepaths who started out the year real well but
has struggled mightily lately. He&#39;s got 10-20 homer power as well, but has only
shown glimpses of it earlier in the year. He&#39;s been in a slump, but he should
become at least an above average centerfielder int he big leages. Reddick is
looking like he could become an above average player or star in the major
leagues. He&#39;s got great contact skills, and has good power as well. Plate
discipline is a problem for him, but the Red Sox have been working with him on
it and that seems to have improved in AA. His defense is great, and his arm is
terrific in the outfield. The next three guys are guys with terrific tools. Lin
was the MVP of the futures game, and he&#39;s got tons of tools but hasn&#39;t shown
the power expect from him. Kalish had a great year last year, but has been
slowed down this year from an injury. Place has huge power potential potential,
but the strikeouts are killing him in Lancaster. Carter has consistently been
producing in AAA, but his defense is, well, awful, but he&#39;s got a great bat
with good power. Overall, our outfield looks real good as far as depth goes,
and looks to only get better with guys like Pete Hissey and Ryan Westmoreland
hopefully signing with the Sox.

<span class="f1 hl">Starting Pitching</span>
Jon Lester (MLB)
Clay Buchholz (MLB)
Justin Masterson (MLB)
<span class="f4 hl">Michael Bowden (AAA)</span>
<span class="f3 hl">Kris Johnson (AA)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Brock Huntzinger (A-)</span>
<span class="f2 hl">Nick Hagadone (A-)</span>

Lester has become a terrific pitcher in the big leagues and is arguably the ace
of the Sox staff right now. Buchholz has been struggling in the big leagues,
but his stuff is amazing and looks to still be a future front of the rotation
starter. The only concerns with Buchholz are fastball command and immaturity
off the field. Masterson has been terrific for the Sox, with a sinker that is
just nasty. If he stays a starter, he could become a number 2 or 3 starter.
Bowden looks terrific this year, dominating AA hitters. He&#39;s got great command
of a 91-93 mile per hour fastball, but his velocity has been inconsistent this
year. He&#39;s got a plus curveball, and a changeup that is definitely still
developing but could become a plus pitch. He looks to be a mid rotation starter
in the big leagues. The rest of the guys all have a lot of potential and are
solid prospects, and each could become great prospects, but it really is too
early to tell with them.

<span class="f1 hl">Relief Pitching</span>
Manny Delcarmen (MLB)
<span class="f3 hl">Daniel Bard (AA)</span>

Last year, Delcarmen looked like a dominant set up. He struggled for most of
this year, but has pitched much better as of late. He&#39;s got a mid-high 90s
fastball and a plus curveball with a good changeup. Bard has a fastball that
has reached as high as 100, but struggles with control of it. He also has a
slider that has looked a strikeout pitch for him. If he can improve command, he
has the stuff to be a big league closer.

I decided to leave off most of our draft picks because truthfully I have no
idea where they would rank in the system. The Sox farm system does look good
though, with a lot of depth and a lot of high impact prospects that are pretty
close to the big league club.
