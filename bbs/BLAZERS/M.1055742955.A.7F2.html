Price:

1. The Blazers denied the 76ers&#39; request to talk to Cheeks,
and despite reports that they had changed their stance,
nothing has changed. They are happy with Cheeks as their
coach and do not want to lose him. Period. And, no, they
have not talked to any other coaches, although there were
rumors that they had an interest in Rick Carlisle after he
was fired from the Pistons. That was not true. Purely
speculation.

2. Rasheed has not changed. He is rigid and unwavering in
his attitude toward outsiders and the media. The perception
is that he is uncomfortable with all the responsibilities
that go with being a team leader, but he is still one of the
league&#39;s most capable players in playing defense against Tim
Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber and the other top
forwards in the Western Conference. While is rigid attitude
is perceived as detrimental to team chemistry, his abilities
as a defender make him too valuable to trade away. The
question becomes, what is more valuable? Good chemistry? Or
good defense? I would like to see the Blazers try to move
Rasheed, but my thinking is that they want him to stay and
they may even consider giving him an extension.

3. Yes, Payton could end up in Portland, although my
thinking is that he probably will end up staying in
Milwaukee. However, it is possible that the Blazers could
consider a sign-and-trade deal and perhaps send a player
such as Rasheed or Bonzi to the Bucks for Payton. If that
were to happen, the Blazers probably would not try to resign
Pippen, who is a free agent and considering whether to play
next season or retire. My guess is that Pippen wants to play
at least one more season and would like to play in Portland,
but his interest would change if Payton were in the mix.
There also is talk that the Blazers might consider hiring
former Bulls GM Jerry Krause as their new GM, and Pippen
would never play for the Blazers if Krause was part of the
management team. Certainly, whoever the new general manager
is will have the biggest say in whether Payton or Pippen
will figure in the team&#39;s immediate future, so let&#39;s wait
and see who the new GM is before talking too much about what
may or may not happen with those two players.

4. The Blazers would like to trade Ruben Patterson and Jeff
McInnis, but it is difficult to say if they will find many
teams interested in either player. Both are signed for at
least the next two seasons, so it is doubtful that either
would be released if a trade couldn&#39;t be worked out. What
I&#39;ve heard is that the Blazers would like to trade both
players if they could, but sometimes those things are easier
said than done, so we&#39;ll have to wait and see. Maybe they
can package one or both players with a more attractive
player, for instance, Bonzi or Derek Anderson, to make a
deal happen. But that&#39;s is all speculation. At this point,
no teams have shown any interest in either player.

5. There are teams that would be interested in Bonzi, and
the Blazers might be interested in trying to move him,
although it is difficult to tell what might happen when the
team doesn&#39;t have a general manager. At this point, I would
think that the Blazers will work with Bonzi, especially if
they are considering moving Rasheed. Then again, if they are
considering keeping Rasheed, then maybe they are thinking
about moving Bonzi to get an outside shooter, say, somebody
like Allen Houston of the Knicks. But without a general
manager in place, it is hard for the Blazers to be talking
about what moves they might be considering. And it is
looking as if a new general manager will not be in place
until after the June 26 draft. I&#39;m guessing a new GM will be
named on June 30 and begin work on July 1 -- the first day
teams are allowed to begin negotiating with free agents. If
I were running the team, I would keep Bonzi, but I think
Maurice may have mixed feelings because of the run-in that
he and Bonzi had late last season.
