What We’re Seeing from Individuals

我們從每個人的身上看到什麼


Brandon Roy remains the heart and leader of this team.  He’s successfully
prosecuting his role as quasi-distributor with responsibility for running the
offense as well as creating it.  Statistically he’s a near-wash with last
season’s averages.  You can see the difference in his style in the play of
Steve Blake, who is now more of a catch-and-shoot off-guard and less of a
true playmaker than he was last season.  Measured by point guard standards Roy
’s assist-to-turnover ratio of 2.4 is nice, though down somewhat from last
season’s 3.2.  Measured by scoring guard standards his 20 ppg and 45.5%
shooting are also nice.  In the spirit of the new millennium, Brandon is a
hybrid we can all be proud of owning.  More impressively than all of that,
Roy has led the Blazers to at least a couple wins, maybe 3-4 depending on how
you look at it, when they otherwise might have crumbled.  This despite being
hounded every night by opposing defenses.  While the new-found attention
seems to frazzle him some nights, his rough games don’t necessarily cause
the Blazers to lose because he is so good at blending in with his teammates
and relying on them.  When they come up short his good games save the day.
 Roy is still growing in confidence and understanding game psychology, but he
’s well on his way to becoming that reliable superstar every contending team
needs.

Brandon Roy維持著他球隊心臟和領導者的地位，他成功著扮演著進攻發動機的角色。
在統計上，他的數據跟去年差不多。在這季你可以很清楚的看到他跟Blake打法的不同，
Blake現在比較像是一個catch-and-shoot的純射手而不是像上季的發動機。
從PG的標準來看Roy的助攻失誤比是很好的2.4，從SG的標準來看Roy的20分和45.5%命中率
也很不錯，Roy是從千禧年來最令我們驕傲的存在。最令人印象深刻的是，有好幾場原本
會崩潰的球賽就是靠他一個人的表現才獲勝的。儘管越來越多的人試著更加看管Roy，他
表現不好時球隊還是可以贏球，因為他在融合整個球隊和信任隊友上真的做的很棒。
Roy在自信和對比賽的心理方面都還在持續成長中，但他在成為每個隊都需要的那種超級
巨星這條路上一直都做得很好。

Big Question Entering the Season:  How would he would handle being the center
of attention?

開季時的疑問：他能面對成為球隊中心焦點嗎？

The answer so far is, “Quite well, thank you.”

目前為止的答案：毫無疑問的棒，謝謝。

Lamarcus Aldridge has been productive but inconsistent.  He looks like the
lost man in the offense compared to last season when he got a steady diet of
touches and shots.  Sometimes the Blazers run the offense through him,
sometimes he’s the weak side back-up plan that never gets used with all of
the three-point shots flying over his head.  His shots, points, field goal
percentage, free throws drawn, free throw percentage, and rebounds are all
down from last season, though none so markedly as to be shocking.
 Nevertheless that is every major stat category for him.  His forte has
always been offense but he seems to finesse his shots more this year than he
did when he was rolling last season.  The face-up jumper and the turn-around
fade-away are his staples.  We don’t see enough of the sweeping hook across
the lane or any interior look, really.  When he gets his feet in the paint he
scores, he just doesn’t get there enough.  Nevertheless he is averaging 16
points per game and remains an indispensible part of the offense.  He just
needs more time to settle in to the “new Blazers”.

Aldridge曾經是穩定績效的來源但並不持續，他跟上季比較起來好像在進攻方面被遺
忘了，有時候進攻完全跟他沒關，有時候他只能看著一顆顆的三分從他頭上飛過。
他的得分，命中率，罰球命中率，罰球數，籃板這些主要的數據全部都比上季低，雖然
不是很令人震驚的退步。他的專長就是進攻，但是他這季好像比較多的是運用技巧的得
分，而不是上季的切入（這邊不太會翻），跳投是他的招牌，我們沒有看到太多的內線
進攻。其實當他在禁區時是很容易得分的，只是他進去的不夠多。儘管如此他的16分還
是整個球隊進攻不可或缺的一部份，他只是需要一些時間去適應＂新拓荒者＂。

Big Question Entering the Season:   How would he fit in alongside Greg Oden
and whether he’d be able to adjust his offense?

開季時的疑問：他要怎麼跟Oden配合?還有怎麼加強他的進攻?

Answer So Far:  We’re still figuring things out but 16 points per game isn’
t awful.

目前為止的答案：我們還在觀察，但一場平均16分並不那麼糟。

Steve Blake has enhanced his Jack-of-All-Trades reputation by morphing from a
set-up man into a three-point specialist.  The surprising thing is not just
how good he is at shooting them (43.3% so far, which would be a career high
easily) but how much the team has come to rely upon him hitting for their
success.  All of those guys who are hounding Brandon Roy and Greg Oden are
coming from somewhere.  The traditional book has been to spare whoever is
assigned to Blake.  When Blake hits you can’t do that.  You’re stuck
picking your poison and praying somebody in scarlet and black an off night.
 That’s exactly what great teams force opponents to do.  The new,
off-guard-ish Blake is playing as many minutes as he ever has and his taking
and hitting more shots than he ever has.  This versatility makes the Blazers
“point” guard future that much more interesting.

Steve Blake 三分的進步使他得到了&#34;能做許多不同工作的人&#34;的好名聲，令人驚奇的不只
是他43.3%的高三分球命中率，還有他對球隊的重要性。Roy和Oden是大家都緊盯的目標，
以前大家認為可以忽略掉Blake專心對付其他人，但現在不行了，他的新能力讓拓荒者的
PG未來變的更加有趣。（這段翻的卡卡的，sorry）

Big Question Entering the Season:  Can he become enough of an offensive
threat to keep opponents honest?

開季前的疑問：他可以在進攻上有威脅讓對手不至於忽略他嗎?

Answer So Far:   Even though he still can’t create for himself he is doing a
fantastic job due to that three-point marksmanship.

目前為止的答案：雖然他沒辦法自己得分，但是他正在做的，令人印象深刻的三分能力
已經夠棒了！

Travis Outlaw’s season has been up and down so far.  Highlight include a
20-point outing in a victory against the Orlando Magic and a 14-point,
13-rebound game against the Houston Rockets on a night when the Blazers
needed every point and rebound they could get.  Lowlights include 8
single-digit scoring performances in 22 games during a season in which he’s
getting more minutes more consistently than he ever has.  Travis’ shots,
points, rebounds, shooting percentage, free throw attempts, and free throw
percentages are all down even though he’s getting as much playing time as he
did last season.  Part of this is that the team isn’t setting him up and
clearing out as much this year.  But the space for a player who needs to work
in isolation to succeed on is limited on this team and will become more so as
the team gels.  The overwhelming positive for Travis has been his success in
shooting the long ball--a valued commodity on this squad.  Outlaw is taking 3
triples per game as opposed to last year’s 1.2 clip, which was in itself a
career high.  He’s also shooting 50% from distance which obliterates last
year’s career high of 39.6% and puts him in rarified company in the league.
 Right now he’s James Jones with hops.  Outlaw has been switching between
small forward and power forward.  He seems more comfortable against slower
opponents.  He’s had little success in getting past quicker forwards.
 Whether his improvement from range balances his singular (sometimes
spectacular, sometimes jarring, sometimes just anemic) performance in other
areas and fits the Blazers’ need at small forward remains an open question.

Outlaw的表現起伏不定，好的時候非常好，爛的時候也令人想罵幹，他的各項數據也是
有少許下滑，一部分的原因是球隊並沒有幫他設定好明確的方向，但是一個球員的表現
空間本來就是需要考量到球隊整體的。而他一個不可能忽略的優點是他的三分球，50%
高檔的表現讓他好像去年的James Jones一樣。他被指派打小前鋒和大前鋒的位置。
看起來他在步調慢的比賽中發揮的比較好。但除了三分球之外他在其他領域的表現
能不能適合拓荒者的未來還是個疑問。

Big Question Entering the Season:  Can Travis finally put together a bankable
run during which he consistently punishes opponents and allows the Blazers to
feel secure playing him?

開季前的疑問:Outlaw可以讓拓荒者享受他的高難度進球時也能安心的用他嗎？

Answer So Far:  Nope.

目前為止的答案：不。


Rudy Fernandez came into the season with great expectations and has managed
to fulfill most of them.  His statistics are more solid than those of the
typical rookie:  26 minutes, 11.4 points, 3 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 43.6%
shooting, 43.4% three-point shooting on 5.1 attempts per game, 95.7% foul
shooting, leading all Blazer smalls in adjusted field goal percentage and
points per shot.  It’s not the quantity of the numbers, it’s the quality.
 The guy is like a robot offensively.   He knows where to be on the court, he
’s always ready to shoot, he never makes you sorry you passed to him.  His
oft-mentioned off-ball movement revolutionized the Blazers’ offense.  It’s
one thing for the coaches to draw it up on a chalkboard.  It’s another to
see it enacted in real time.  Rudy made the Blazers believers that this
unselfish, move-and-pick offense could work.  He’s still learning the league
defensively.  He’s also adjusting to the reality that with 82 games spaced
so closely there are some nights you’re just going to be off.  If those are
all the rookie pains you have you’re doing something right.  His strongest
asset remains his ability to enhance any lineup combination.  He’s not
dominant, he’s complementary in the best sense of the word.

我，Rudy Fernandez是伴隨著很大的期許而進入這個聯盟的，而也滿足了大部份的目標。
我的統計資料比大多數的新秀都還亮眼，26mins,11.4ps,3rebs,1.8asts/game,43.4%的
三分球命中率和95.7%的罰球命中率把整個拓荒者的後場數據都刷得更好看。這不只是數
量上的差異，而是品質！我就像一個進攻機器，我知道我該待在球場上的哪裡，我總是準
備好投球。我永遠不會讓你們失望。我的跑動和進攻帶動了整個拓荒者進攻的革命，這讓
教練們不僅是畫戰術板，而是看到它真正在場上實現：不自私的流動球和跑位製造空檔是
真的能實行的。不過，我還在學習防守，還有如何打82場比賽，所以有時候我會失常。
這也是每個新秀都要面對的。我的才能讓我不管跟誰在場上都能有表現，我不是具有統治
力的那種人，但我的互補性是言語無法形容的。
（他真的很誇我喔，不是我在自High~XD）

Big Question Entering the Season:  How long will it take him to adjust to the
NBA game?

開季前的疑問:他要花多少時間才能適應NBA比賽?

Answer So Far:  Done and done.  Oh, and I cleaned your gutters, changed the
oil in the van, and taught your daughter some Chopin on the piano.  Did you
have anything else for me to do this afternoon?

目前為止的答案：全部都完成了，而且我還清理了你的水溝，幫你的發財車加油，還教了你女兒一些蕭邦
的鋼琴曲，還有什麼我能為您效勞的嗎？

Joel Przybilla’s role figured to morph with Greg Oden coming on board and
presumably taking the starting center position.  Greg’s early-season injury
postponed those plans, thrusting Joel into the spotlight once again.  It may
have been a blessing in disguise, as Pryzbilla got a strong start to the
season and hasn’t let up yet.  His response to the Big Change has been to
cram every bit of goodness he can into every possession.  As a result he’s
averaging about as many minutes as a reserve as he did in the starting role
last year.  Joel’s pick-setting and rebounding are as immaculate as ever.  He
’s still defending well, of course.  Now that the Blazer Backstop duties are
shared with Oden you see a more carefree approach to the game.  He’s not on
himself for every foul.  He’s just playing ball.  Oh, and there’s that
81.4% shooting clip.  The combination of deep shooting and penetration dishes
on this team leave the center in a Nothing But Dunks offense with nobody
between him and the rim.  Welcome to paradise, Mr. Przybilla.  Joel has been
one of the anchors of this team…the guy who does his job every night no
matter what.  It’s a great example for the young players, star and
role-player alike.

大P原本的任務是要幫Oden適應一下後就回到替補，但冏歐開季的受傷使得計畫被迫延期
，他的好表現是最好的禮物，他在每一波的球權裡做到他可以做的所有事。大P的籃板和
手感毫無瑕疵，防守也還是令人信任。現在Oden回來後大P打得更輕鬆，因為裁判更不會
婊他，他只要專心打球，做他該做的事就好。拓荒者的跳投和切入後的小給球讓大P和
籃框之間沒有距離，他要做也只能做的就是灌籃。大P是球隊的支柱之一，他沒有華麗的
球風，他只是做他該做的工作，這也是許多年輕球員該學的，怎樣當個好的功能性球員。

Big Question Entering the Season:  How will a reduced role affect Joel’s
game?

開季前的疑問：Oden回來後會不會壓縮到大P的表現?

Answer So Far:  Hasn’t happened so far because he’s flourishing.

目前為止的答案:目前為止並沒有發生，因為他是那麼的棒。

Greg Oden has been occasionally brilliant, often frustrated, and mostly
learning on the job so far this year.  The best things about his game right
now are the ones that come naturally.  His huge size makes getting around him
difficult for opponents.  You can forget the rebound if he’s boxing you out.
 He’s like a vacuum cleaner down there.  He’ll get up and block some shots.
 And if you ever give him daylight near the offensive rim you can expect an
instant and overwhelming flush.  Even the base-level Greg Oden has changed
the Blazers in a way nobody else could.  The attention he draws is
irreplaceable.  On the other end of the spectrum his mechanics need a ton of
work.  His offensive footwork is worse than rudimentary.  He sometimes breaks
the defense through poor (or no) rotations.  He doesn’t have much of a shot.
 He gets stripped a ton because he doesn’t protect the ball.  Of all the
things he’s missing right now the dearest is his pre-surgery ability to rise
from a flat-footed stand and ram the ball home.  When your offense is limited
to dunks lack of lift really kills you.  How many times have we seen him grab
an offense rebound under the bucket and then have to hesitate and make an
awkward move to try and get free, resulting in a strip, block, or travel?
 That goes away if he’s 100%.  But that’s not going to happen for a while,
which should give him a chance to learn other ways of dealing with those
situations…like some offensive fundamentals.  He also has to bring the
fouling under control…a notoriously hard progression for big men to make.
 That aside, no single big man has created more change in the Blazers since
Rasheed Wallace came on board back in 1996.  And the player with that
designation before Rasheed was Bill Walton.  That bodes well for Oden’s
career.  For now 7.9 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks will have to do.

Oden這季目前為止的表現，除了偶爾的令人驚艷，大部分都還是失意的。他也還在學習著
如何做好他的工作。他現在最棒的表現還是他的身體素質，他的巨大身軀讓對手難以越雷
池一步，當他在籃下時就像一個真空吸塵器，你可以不需要去搶籃板了。還有他如果在靠
近籃框的位置拿到球，你可以期待他會狠狠的把球塞進去。可以說他的到來改變了整個球
隊的等級，這是沒有其他人能做到的。因為他的吸引防守能力驚人。在另外一方面來說，
他還很需要加強他的技巧。他的進攻腳步甚至比以前還差。所以他沒什麼進攻能力。
他也沒辦法很好的保護球。他目前為止失去最多的是受傷前的那種直接把球猛灌進籃框的
能力。當你被限制灌籃能力後真的很傷。我們已經有幾次看到他拿下個進攻籃板後卻猶豫
不決然後做了笨拙的移動結果被蓋被抄或是被判走步了？如果他百分之百復原，這些都不
會再有。但是這不是最近會發生的事，所以我們必須給他一點機會去學習一些其他的方法
和進攻手段去面對這類的情況。他也必須去面對他的犯規麻煩問題，這是每個大個兒都必
需克服的。但是，撇開這一切，在溪蛙之後他是第一個能給球隊帶來這麼大變化的長人，
而在溪蛙之前的是Bill Walton，這也可以做為Oden最好表現的預期，不過要達到這個目標
他還必須讓他現在的數據翻倍才差不多。


Big Question Entering the Season:  How much can he show early?

開季前的疑問:他能發揮和表現到什麼程度?

Answer So Far:  Just a fraction of his eventual potential, but it’s already
helping.

目前為止的答案:只有他完整潛力的一小部分，但已經對球隊有幫助了。


Nicolas Batum surprised everybody around the league by earning the starting
small forward role from the second game of the season on.  He does it by
playing aggressive defense, rebounding, and hitting the open shot when it’s
presented to him.  He still has a ways to go physically and he has more
offensive skill than he’s showing right now.  However he does have the
ability to blend into the offense instead of warping it…a clear advantage on
this team over Travis Outlaw.  Whether Batum has been a stopgap measure with
Martell Webster’s injury or whether he’s carved out a space in the rotation
remains to be seen, but either way he’s acquitted himself well.

Batum獲得了先發這件事讓每個聯盟裡的人都感到驚訝，他用籃板，積極的防守和空檔的
三分很好的詮釋了他的工作。雖然他有好體能，不過他還是有許多進攻技巧可以學習。
他有能力去融入進攻，而不是擾亂進攻，對照組是Outlaw。不管他只是Webster的暫時替
代品或者是會持續留在輪替陣容裡，他都已經做到了他能做的好表現。

Big Question Entering the Season:  Can he be a player in this league?

開季前的疑問：他能夠在聯盟中活下去嗎？

Answer So Far:  YES.  Defense, rebounding, distance shooting, and offensive
continuity are always in style.  In fact he might become one of the players
to get excited about.

目前為止的回答：可以的，防守，籃板，三分，還有進攻的串連性都是他的能力，事實上
他可能會變成最令大家興奮的球員之一。

Sergio Rodriguez spent last season in limbo:  frustrated, disjointed, and in
the coach’s doghouse.  His future with the Blazers looked to be up in the
air entering this season.  Had he come out directionless, mistake-prone, or
even discouraged he could have easily gotten buried in the rotation.
Instead two things happened.  First the Blazers offense opened up.  The team
is now populated with players who know the value of cutting through the
interior and being prepared to shoot outside.  That means Sergio’s passes
find better targets than they ever have.  Second, Sergio didn’t come out
directionless, mistake-prone, or discouraged.  He came out playing
professionally.  It’s been a classic case of circumstances opening up
opportunity for a player and that player seizing it.  Rodriguez is now firmly
ensconced as the team’s back-up point guard, not only eating into Steve
Blakes minutes but keeping lottery pick Jerryd Bayless on the bench.  Sergio’
s passing remains as strong as ever.  His improvement in three areas has made
him more than just an assist machine though.  First, even though he’s no
better of a perimeter defender than most of the Blazer guards, he’s no worse
either.  Last year you’d notice Sergio constantly on defense for his glaring
mistakes.  You just don’t notice him much on that end of the floor now.  That
’s a good thing.  Also he’s beginning to take advantage of the things he
can do defensively.  He moves his feet quickly and does a better job staying
in front of his man without losing focus or getting bodied out of the way.
 He also roams the passing lane and occasionally generates turnovers.  Second
Sergio has better recognition of his place in the overall offense as a point
guard.  Last year you’d say, “Look! SERGIO passed to somebody who scored.”
  This year you say, “Oooh…nice dunk Rudy!  Hey…Sergio set him up there.”
  Finally, even though he’s not shooting any better overall and still isn’t
able to finish well off of the drive, he is hitting the long ball and looking
more confident in his shot overall.  Considering where he came from, Sergio
has shown us a lot.  He’s getting more important minutes because of it.

Sergio上季的表現就像在地獄一樣，挫敗的，失意的，毫無章法的，整個就被關在教練的
狗屋裡。他在季初看起來就不像在拓荒者的未來裡，他的容易犯錯的特質讓他很難正常的
輪替。但這些都沒有發生，取而代之的是兩件事：拓荒者的進攻變的更加開放了，現在拓
荒者因為內外都有的球風而漸漸受歡迎，這代表著SROD的傳球目標變的比以前任何時候都
還要多。第二點，以上那些缺點都沒有發生，相反的，他表現的很專業。他緊緊抓住了他
表現的機會，這讓他站穩了替補控球的角色，但擠壓到的不是Blake的時間，而是樂透區
選來的Bayless。他的傳球跟以前一樣好，甚至更好，他的三分球也有所進步，這讓他不
只是一個助攻機器而已了，雖然他的防守還是很糟，但沒有更不好的事情了。去年你可能
會注意到他在防守上持續的＂耀眼的＂錯誤，而忽略了他其他的好表現。他現在也開始增
強他的防守，他更快速的移動他的腳步並且緊盯著他的敵人而不是恍神就被過，他也常常
深入敵陣然後尋找傳球機會，雖然有時候會產生失誤。而最大的改變是，他的傳球能力逐
漸被大家記住，去年你可能會說Sergio傳球給某人，然後他得分了，但是今年你說的卻是
&#34;Ruuuuudy!!!!好球~Sergio傳的超漂亮!!!!西班牙連線!!!!!&#34;。最後，雖然他的得分能力
還是很缺乏，他還是在持續的增強他的投射能力中。想想吧，他是哪裡來的？（譯：歐洲
專出射手），他正在獲得更多的上場機會因為他的改變。

Big Question Entering the Season:  How will Sergio approach the season?

開季時的疑問：Sergio這季會達到什麼程度?

Answer So Far:  Like a pro.

目前為止的回答:像個專業人士。（是這樣翻嗎？）

Channing Frye has had a rough go of it so far.  The outside shot is his only
reliable weapon.  When he hits hit he tends to shoot the lights out.  When he
’s off it’s a long night.  Technically, though, it’s been a short night
because he doesn’t do enough other things--defend, rebound, pick, drive,
post--to keep him on the floor.  He either hits the jumper or he sits.  41.6%
shooting isn’t awful if you’re a 6’4” gunner but from your power forward
it’s 7-8% below what you’d like to see.  The pattern of Channing playing
better with more minutes has generally held true.  When he gets long
stretches you start to see him relax and contribute.  He’s just not the type
of guy to live or die with a 4-minute stretch.  That makes coming off the
bench problematic.  There aren’t a ton of minutes left on this team and if
you can’t claim short ones with authority you won’t get longer ones.
 Channing hasn’t played authoritatively and that’s pretty much his story.

Frye開季目前為止的表現很粗糙，不怎麼樣。外線跳投是他唯一的武器，他只能靠手感吃
飯，有手感的時候固然很好，但沒手感時就會是一個漫長的夜晚。呃，嚴格來說，是一個
很短的夜晚，因為他沒有做到任何足以讓他留在場上的事。41.6%的命中率對長人來說很
不及格。當你給他充分的時間他會表現的好些，他不是那種熱機很快的球員，可是這也是
問題的所在，在這個球隊中你已經沒有太多多餘的時間了。你必須在短時間內有可靠的表
現才有機會爭取更長的時間。Frye沒有可靠的表現，這就是他的情況。

Big Question Entering the Season:  Can he carve out some playing time in a
crowded frontcourt?

開季前的疑問：他可以在日趨擁擠的前場中開拓上場時間嗎？

Answer So Far:  Not with a Ginsu he couldn’t.

目前為止的答案：（不會翻）不過他不行。

Jerryd Bayless has barely seen the floor this season.  He’s not looked
comfortable captaining the offense.  He’s not been overly aggressive getting
his own either…probably wanting to show that he can be a point guard first,
which is what this team needs right now.  Most of all, Nate McMillan likes
stability from his point guards and so a rookie will have trouble cracking
that rotation even under the best of circumstances.  With Blake and Rodriguez
having the best seasons of their careers Bayless remains nailed to the pines.

Bayless這季幾乎沒有在場上出現過，他看起來還不能很好的帶領球隊的進攻，他好像更
傾向於證明自己可以做個球隊目前所需要的控球後衛，而不是發揮他的進攻本性。
最重要的是，Nate McMillian喜歡穩定而令人放心的控球後衛，所以一個新人控球就算在
最好的情況下也很難插進輪替陣容裡。而Blake和SROD都正在打出他們最棒的球季，看來
短期內Bayless還是只能守好開特力和偶爾給攝影機一個淡淡的哀愁了。

Big Question Entering the Season:  Will he get a chance to dazzle?

開季前的疑問：他有機會表現的令人眼睛為之一亮嗎？

Answer So Far:  Not so far.  And maybe the better question is whether he’s
supposed to dazzle.

目前為止的答案：並沒有，還有或許比較好的問法是，他有準備好要發光了嗎？



The Bottom Line:

大致上的概要

The bottom line so far this season is simply the record.  15-7 is incredible.
 Whatever the Blazers are doing right or wrong they’re pulling out wins.
 That’s what this league is about.  We’ll see prettier ball from the
Blazers as time goes by.  It’s hard to imagine seeing a better winning
percentage.

目前為止最簡單明瞭衡量他們表現的就是戰績了，15勝7敗是讓人難以置信的好，不管他
們正在做的事是對的還錯的，他們正在取勝。我們會看到他們打得更好，而且，真的很難
想像看見更好的勝率了！




終於翻完了
兩篇翻了我6小時XD~不過翻的很開心就是了
有錯麻煩請糾正~至於我個人的意見
我已經沒力了，等等還要上場打球呢XD~
