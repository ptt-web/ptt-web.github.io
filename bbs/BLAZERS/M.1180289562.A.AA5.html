有需要翻譯的話說一聲..:P



<span class="f1 hl">Patrick Ewing:</span> Oden right now is most similar to Patrick Ewing
(also as a freshman); very little offensive game but physically
intimidating and scary on D. Patrick developed an offensive game
and then reinvented himself even after an injury left him inferior
to what he once had been. He developed some range, he was dangerous
inside and he was a pretty efficient volume scorer. Underrated
defensively, Ewing played D more with his head than his athleticism
than either Olajuwon or Robinson. He was more about position and
timing and anticipation than those guys, who used ridiculous speed
and hops to do a lot of their work.

<span class="f1 hl">Alonzo Mourning:</span> Shorter, smaller (but in stunning physical
condition), very awkward and ugly on offense, not a very good
passer... IMO, Oden&#39;s already a better offensive player, it just
remains to be seen if he&#39;ll have the opportunity to show it and if
he will have the poise and know-how to effectively handle double-teams
at the NBA level. &#39;Zo never impressed me on offense and I really always
hated watching him with the ball, from his Charlotte days onward.
He was and remains, however, an outstanding defender and I could see
Oden being of similar value in that respect. Still, I expect Oden to
be a more capable offensive player. &#39;Zo&#39;s offensive stats are nice but
his impact on the game was always bleh... on offense, of course.

<span class="f1 hl">David Robinson:</span> For the nth time, D-Rob and Oden are totally unalike.
They play a dissimilar brand of defense (you&#39;ll almost never see Oden
past the foul line) and they&#39;re TOTALLY different offensive players.
Robinson was a natural shooter even before he hit Navy and he just got
nastier and nastier through his college career. He also played face-up
and Oden never does that.

<span class="f1 hl">Tim Duncan:</span> Duncan&#39;s an interesting option; statistically, he seems
likely to be the most similar (maybe a little more shot-blocking,
though). I expect Oden to master a couple of post moves and go with
those. Stylistically though, Duncan does too much face-up work and
has too much range on his J and just... Well even when he was being
recruited, he had some handles and that J in its beginning form and
Oden isn&#39;t there yet. I don&#39;t see him being like Duncan ITO style.
Duncan&#39;s mainly a backdown guy, and in that respect they&#39;ll probably
be similar, but Duncan&#39;s a lot more versatile offensively than most
credit him as being and I don&#39;t think Oden&#39;ll be like that.

<span class="f1 hl">Hakeem Olajuwon:</span> Dream came into the league with quickness, hops and
power. Oden&#39;ll have the last two but he won&#39;t be as agile as Olajuwon,
who was just a freak athlete in all categories. His game developed as
time went on and he eventually developed the nastiest low-post arsenal
I can think of off the top of my head but I doubt they resemble
eachother on offense, since most of Dream&#39;s moves were based around
quickness and Oden isn&#39;t nearly the same kind of lateral athlete.

<span class="f1 hl">Bill Russell:</span> Oden&#39;s already more skilled offensively, ITO low post
scoring and nothing like Russell ITO high post offense. Russell is
routinely forgotten in conversations about the best passing bigs of
all-time but here&#39;s a guy who was a 4.3 apg player on his career and
had an 81-game season as a 5.8 apg guy in the last couple years of
his career. He was a pretty nasty high post guy and Oden&#39;s gonna be a
low post player, for sure. Defensively, I can see the similarity in
terms of impact and relative talent compared to the rest of the league.
He&#39;ll be a dominant shot-blocker, probably, but Russell (like Olajuwon)
had a lot more quickness and agility about him and was far more mobile
than Oden (not that Greg&#39;s a stiff).

<span class="f1 hl">Marcus Camby:</span> Please. Camby&#39;s way thinner, has a 15-footer than Oden
hasn&#39;t evidenced yet and has almost no ability to score from the post.
He&#39;s a brilliant rebounder, a competent offensive player and totally
unlike Oden.

<span class="f1 hl">Shaquille O&#39;Neal:</span> This is tough; ITO style, I think they&#39;ll be VERY
similar. They&#39;re about the same size at the same stage of their careers.
Shaq was about 260 at the end of high school and was between 270 and 295
during his college career (he hit the NBA around 290, 295). They have
similar ups. I remember Shaq as the quicker guy, especially on that
baseline spin, but that could be a result of him having better footwork
and being stronger, too... when he got you on his hip, it was pretty
much impossible to recover in time to stop his spin, which was part of
why it was so effective.

But I see Oden working a lot on footwork, jumphooks in the lane and
just outside of it, I see his offensive arsenal being very similar to
Shaq&#39;s. I dunno if he&#39;ll be anywhere close to as prolific or efficient,
because Shaq was a monster, but still.

In terms of style alone, I think on offense, he&#39;s the most comparable.
Oden already has more range than Shaq though, he&#39;s reasonably effective
with a 12-foot jumphook, so that makes the life of the defense a lot more
difficult. Shaq&#39;s also a lot stronger and more physical, while Oden
hasn&#39;t really gotten aggressive or super-physical yet. Maybe that&#39;ll
come in time.

Shaq was also a LOT more skilled at this stage of his career. It&#39;s
fashionable to hate on Shaq for being a big brute but people forget
that he actually has horrendously underrated handling ability (e.g.
lead the fastbreak ability) and passing skills. At LSU and in HS, he
used to routinely toss no-look, behind-the-back passes and all manner
of other random BS that you wouldn&#39;t expect of a behemoth like him.
Oden right now doesn&#39;t have nearly the skill-set Shaq did at the same
stage in terms of diversity of his game. Dick Vitale had a boner for
Shaq so huge, ESPN actually had to rebuild an entire wing of their
building because he busted a wall after he saw Shaq at the McDonald&#39;s
All-Star game when Shaq was finishing up HS.

So...

Again, speaking exclusively from the standpoint of style, I think Shaq&#39;s
the most comparable in terms of how he&#39;ll look and work on offense, while
Patrick Ewing/Dikembe Mutombo/Duncan with more blocks are probably the
best defensive comparisons.

It&#39;s a tough call, he&#39;s 19 years old, blessed with a body very similar
to Shaq&#39;s and he&#39;s a hard worker, so the potential for him to develop
his game is astronomical, as high as you could ever rate it.
