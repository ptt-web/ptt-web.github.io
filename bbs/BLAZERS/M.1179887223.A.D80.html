<span class="f2">※ 引述《Rostow (When?)》之銘言：
</span><span class="f6">: Blazers get No. 1 pick; Celtics, Grizzlies slip down
</span><span class="f6">: Associated Press
</span><span class="f6">: Updated: May 22, 2007, 9:32 PM ET
</span><span class="f6">: SECAUCUS, N.J. -- The Portland Trail Blazers beat the odds and won the right
</span><span class="f6">: to settle the Greg Oden-Kevin Durant debate.
</span>  拓荒者擊敗其他對手，獲得選秀會中要選擇Greg Oden或Kevin Durant的甜蜜煩惱

<span class="f6">: With just a 5.3 percent chance of winning the No. 1 pick, the Blazers won the
</span><span class="f6">: NBA&#39;s draft lottery Tuesday night, earning the right to draft a potential
</span><span class="f6">: franchise player from what&#39;s considered to be a deep class.
</span>  僅僅只有5.3%機率的情況下，波特蘭在選秀抽籤夜中獲得狀元籤，贏得一位具有潛
  力將球隊帶往更強等級的關鍵球員

<span class="f6">: Represented by Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy, the Blazers got a head start
</span><span class="f6">: on landing next year&#39;s top rookie. They will almost certainly choose between
</span><span class="f6">: Oden, the Ohio State center, or Durant, Texas&#39; high-scoring forward.
</span>  波特蘭獲得最好的機會重現今年的最佳新秀，幾乎可以確定他們會選中鋒Greg Oden
  或具有得分力的高大前鋒Kevin Durant

<span class="f6">: &#34;They&#39;re going to help us right away,&#34; Roy said. &#34;They can come into the NBA
</span><span class="f6">: right away and play. I&#39;m just excited about sitting back and knowing our
</span><span class="f6">: general manager has the choice of drafting either Kevin Durant or Greg Oden.
</span><span class="f6">: Either one, you can&#39;t go wrong. So I&#39;m excited we have the opportunity to
</span><span class="f6">: choose between the two.&#34;
</span>  Roy表示&#34;她們將可以立即幫助我們。他們倆位是NBA的即戰力，我很興奮我們總管會
  選擇他們其中哪一位，哪一位都是不會錯的，所以我真的很興奮有機會去選擇其中
  一位&#34;(ROY看起來真的很興奮啊..)

<span class="f6">: The 7-foot Oden is the likely top pick, because dominant centers are harder
</span><span class="f6">: to find.
</span>  7呎中鋒Oden是最可能的選擇，畢竟具有統治力的中鋒是很難尋找滴

  ===================以下就比較不重要了，所以..==============================
<span class="f6">: Regardless of who goes No. 1, both players are likely headed to the
</span><span class="f6">: Northwest, as Seattle also moved up into second. Atlanta got the third pick
</span><span class="f6">: -- and needed it. Falling out of the top three would have meant sending the
</span><span class="f6">: pick to Phoenix.
</span><span class="f6">: The lottery determined the top three spots, with the rest of the teams going
</span><span class="f6">: in reverse order of a team&#39;s finish.
</span><span class="f6">: Memphis and Boston, which had the worst records in the league and the best
</span><span class="f6">: chance of landing in the top two, slipped to fourth and fifth, respectively.
</span><span class="f6">: Milwaukee will go sixth, followed by Minnesota, Charlotte and Chicago, which
</span><span class="f6">: had the rights to New York&#39;s pick through the Eddy Curry trade.
</span><span class="f6">: Sacramento goes 10th, followed by the Hawks, Philadelphia, New Orleans and
</span><span class="f6">: the Los Angeles Clippers.
</span><span class="f6">: With Oden and Durant highlighting a draft that includes the core of Florida&#39;s
</span><span class="f6">: consecutive NCAA championship teams, the June 28 draft in New York is
</span><span class="f6">: expected to be one of the NBA&#39;s best in years.
</span><span class="f6">: &#34;Tonight we&#39;re looking at what&#39;s probably going to be the deepest draft in a
</span><span class="f6">: couple of decades,&#34; commissioner David Stern said earlier Tuesday.
</span>

<span class="f6">: Portland had a great draft night in 2006, landing Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge
</span><span class="f6">: through trades. They won&#39;t need a deal this time thanks to some lottery luck.
</span>  波特蘭有個成功的2006的選秀，所以不需要一些為這次選秀無謂的交易

<span class="f6">: The SuperSonics will get a player that in many other years would have gone
</span><span class="f6">: No. 1, and maybe whichever player it is can help save the NBA in Seattle. The
</span><span class="f6">: Sonics haven&#39;t been able to get a new arena and aren&#39;t guaranteed to be in
</span><span class="f6">: Seattle past next season.
</span><span class="f6">: The Hawks were the other big winner Tuesday. Moving up one spot saved them
</span><span class="f6">: from having to send their pick to the Suns as a result of the Joe Johnson
</span><span class="f6">: trade. And Atlanta also picked up Indiana&#39;s pick, No. 11, from the Al
</span><span class="f6">: Harrington deal since the Pacers stayed put.
</span><span class="f6">: The presence of the two freshmen superstars added more hype than usual to
</span><span class="f6">: this year&#39;s lottery. There were nearly 100 media credential requests, far
</span><span class="f6">: more than usual.
</span><span class="f6">: It also led to speculation that some teams didn&#39;t try their best to win
</span><span class="f6">: games, hoping to improve their chances of landing a top-two pick. Because of
</span><span class="f6">: all the tanking talk, Stern said he wants NBA owners to look at the lottery
</span><span class="f6">: this summer to see if a new system is needed.
</span><span class="f6">: But the losing didn&#39;t pay off. The Grizzlies had a 25 percent chance of
</span><span class="f6">: winning No. 1 after finishing with the league&#39;s worst record, but they will
</span><span class="f6">: pick fourth in Jerry West&#39;s last draft with the team. Ten years after missing
</span><span class="f6">: out on Tim Duncan, Boston had more lottery heartbreak, falling from the No. 2
</span><span class="f6">: spot. Milwaukee will go sixth.
</span><span class="f6">: Oden averaged 15.7 points, 9.6 rebounds and 3.3 rebounds while leading Ohio
</span><span class="f6">: State to the national championship game, even though he was limited for much
</span><span class="f6">: of the season while recovering from right wrist surgery.
</span><span class="f6">: Durant was even better in his only season at Texas, becoming the first
</span><span class="f6">: freshman in NCAA history to win player of the year honors. The 6-foot-9
</span><span class="f6">: forward led the Big 12 with 25.8 points and 11.1 rebounds per game, and was
</span><span class="f6">: the AP national player of the year.
