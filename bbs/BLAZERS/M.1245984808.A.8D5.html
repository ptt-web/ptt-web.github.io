</span>Blazeredge 的 Ben 在他選秀前的drafy board 對於 Pendergraph 的描述

Pendergraph shoots straight to the top of the board because of his physical
skills, his likely availability at pick 24, his good locker room presence,
intelligence and personality, his energy and, most importantly, his NBA
readiness. If the Blazers keep their pick at 24, he seems like a great
option. There&#39;s no really strong argument against him.  Also, I&#39;m reliably
informed that his advanced stats are near the very top of the nation for
college players as well. The fact that he plays a position that the Blazers
have identified as a need is just the icing on the cake.
