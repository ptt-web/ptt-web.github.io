PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Blazers went with a
big starting lineup to open exhibition play,
and coach Maurice Cheeks says to expect more
experimentation to come.

The Blazers started Tuesday night&#39;s 104-80
victory over the Houston Rockets with Rasheed
Wallace, Zach Randolph, Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje,
Bonzi Wells and Damon Stoudamire.

Boumtje-Boumtje was starting in place of Dale
Davis. Starting guard Derek Anderson didn&#39;t
make an appearance until later in the first
quarter.

&#34;It&#39;s going to depend on match-ups we have,&#34;
Cheeks said. &#34;Certain matchups may not be
conducive to using Rasheed, Dale and Zach in
the front court.&#34;

Wallace scored 19 points, and Randolph had 18
points and eight rebounds to lead the Blazers
in the exhibition opener for both teams Tuesday
night.


As Yao Ming watched from the bench in street
clothes, Alex Scales led the Rockets with 11
points. Kelvin Cato had nine points and eight
rebounds.

&#34;We played bad,&#34; Houston&#39;s new coach Jeff Van
Gundy said.

The Trail Blazers began to pull away late in
the first quarter. Jeff McInnis&#39; layup made
it 24-17, before his steal and a well-placed
pass to Ruben Patterson under the basket for
a dunk made it 26-17.

The Blazers, who experimented with different
on-court combinations, went up 40-21 on Randolph&#39;s
slam midway through the second quarter. They
led 46-34 at the half.

The Blazers went up 98-71 on Qyntel Woods&#39;
dunk with just under three minutes to play.

&#34;I thought tonight we got good results with
the big front line and playing Bonzi at shooting
guard,&#34; Cheeks said. &#34;But we won&#39;t necessarily
do that in every game.&#34;

Yao arrived in the United States on Sunday,
after playing for China&#39;s national team --
which won the Asian Games title and a spot
in the 2004 Olympics. He&#39;s had just one
practice with the Rockets.

In addition to Van Gundy, the Rockets made
key player moves in the offseason by acquiring
forward Jim Jackson and center John Amaechi.

The Blazers didn&#39;t look much different.
Starting guard Scottie Pippen went to the
Chicago Bulls via free agency, while Lithuanian
center Arvydas Sabonis retired. Guard Antonio
Daniels also left as a free agent, but otherwise
the team remained intact.

Center Dale Davis did not start for the Blazers
because of a groin strain. He also was not
expected to play Thursday when the Blazers
travel to McArthur Court at the University
of Oregon for an exhibition game against Sacramento.
