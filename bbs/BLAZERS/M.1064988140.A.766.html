PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers swingman <span class="f2 hl">Qyntel Woods</span>
has been cited for <span class="f3 hl">driving with a suspended license and no proof of
</span><span class="f3 hl">insuranc</span>e, Portland police said Tuesday.

It was the second time in 10 days that a member of the Trail Blazers
has faced similar charges.

Woods was stopped Monday night in northeast Portland for a turn
signal violation, said Police Bureau spokesman Officer Henry Groepper.

Officers impounded his 2002 Cadillac Escalade.

Oregon Division of Motor Vehicle records reviewed by KGW-TV showed
his license was suspended twice in recent months.

In March, police said they stopped Woods and found marijuana in his
car. When asked to produce his drivers license and proof of
insurance, Woods reportedly provided officers with his rookie trading
card as identification.

He provided proof of insurance in July to lift the suspension.

His license was suspended again on July 28 for failure to appear for
a court hearing, DMV records show. It was unclear why Woods was
ordered to appear.

Rasheed Wallace was ticketed for driving with a suspended license and
without insurance last month, prompting police to impound his 1997
Mercedes.

Last winter, Washington State Police pulled over Wallace and teammate
Damon Stoudamire in Stoudamire&#39;s Hummer on their way back from a
game in Seattle.

Both were cited for misdemeanor marijuana possession.

Stoudamire has since been charged with marijuana possession in Arizona,
the latest in a long list of problems team members have faced on and
off the court in recent months.
