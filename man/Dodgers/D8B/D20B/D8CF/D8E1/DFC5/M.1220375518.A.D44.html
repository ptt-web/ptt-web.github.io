Shortstop Rafael Furcal, who has missed the Dodgers&#39; last five games because
of lower back pain, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday. The move
is retroactive to May 6, meaning the earliest Furcal can be activated is May
21 for the final game of a three-game series at Dodger Stadium against
Cincinnati.

<span class="f3 hl">Furcal因為背部的不適,所以在禮拜一被放入DL 15 天</span>

Furcal&#39;s place on the active roster will be taken by utility infielder Luis
Maza, whose contract was purchased from triple-A Las Vegas. Maza, a
27-year-old career minor leaguer, can play shortstop, second base, third base
and the three outfield positions, providing the Dodgers with much-needed
versatility.
<span class="f3 hl">道奇從三A把 Luis Maza 叫上來, 他是個工具人</span>

Furcal, whose .366 batting average is third in the majors, didn&#39;t travel with
the Dodgers to Milwaukee for a three-game series that starts today. He
underwent an MRI exam Monday morning that showed he had a strained back. He
will receive a cortisone shot today and start rehabilitation with team
physical therapist Sue Falsone on Wednesday.
<span class="f3 hl">Furcal 禮拜一做了MRI的檢查,顯示出他那緊緊的背部</span>

&#34;He said he should be ready to come off [the DL] next week,&#34; said Furcal&#39;s
agent, Paul Kinzer.
<span class="f3 hl">他自己覺得他很快就會好了</span>

Furcal said Sunday that the pain he felt in his lower back was similar to
what he felt last September, when he had to sit out 12 games.
<span class="f3 hl">他覺得現在背的感覺跟去年九月的時候一樣</span>

&#34;This is the type of thing where it feels fine one day and it doesn&#39;t the
next,&#34; he said.

With Furcal out of the lineup, the Dodgers have lost their last four games.
They scored a combined two runs in the three games leading up to their series
finale Sunday against the Houston Astros, which they lost.

Furcal&#39;s last game was on May 5, when the Dodgers beat the New York Mets,
5-1, to win for the ninth time in 10 games.

&#34;It&#39;s difficult,&#34; Furcal said of being forced out of the lineup. &#34;We were
playing well.&#34;

Furcal&#39;s absence also troubled the Dodgers on defense. With Furcal and second
baseman Jeff Kent resting Sunday, Manager Joe Torre started rookies Chin-lung
Hu and Delwyn Young in the middle of an already young infield that included
rookie third baseman Blake DeWitt and second-year first baseman James Loney.
With no other infielders available, Torre said catcher Russell Martin was
backup shortstop for the day.

The versatility of Maza should help remedy that problem.

The major league call-up is Maza&#39;s first. He spent eight years in the
Minnesota Twins organization but was released at the end of the 2006 season.
The Dodgers signed him in 2007. Maza entered this season a career .273
hitter, but has taken advantage of hitter-friendly Cashman Field in Las Vegas
and is hitting .402 this season. He had a 19-game hitting streak from April
11 to May 3.
<span class="f3 hl">Maza之前是在雙城隊的農場  今年在道奇三A的AVG是.402</span>

Jason Schmidt, who threw a 1-2-3 inning in his first minor league rehab start
on Sunday, will throw a bullpen session in Milwaukee on Wednesday . . . James
McDonald of double-A Jacksonville, who was the Dodgers&#39; minor league pitcher
of the year last season, was 1-0 in his two starts last week, giving up two
earned runs in 13 innings and striking out 16.
<span class="f3 hl">禮拜日Schmidt在小聯盟投了一局</span>

還有聽說美國時間禮拜六對上天使隊時, Kershaw有可能會來先發 ,不是郭泓志就是他
