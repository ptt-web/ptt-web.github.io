CINCINNATI -- With Rafael Furcal limited to playing catch, Dodgers Manager
Joe Torre said he didn&#39;t expect his leadoff hitter and starting shortstop
back until after the All-Star break.

Furcal, who has a bulging disk in his back, was tied for the team lead in
runs scored with Russell Martin when the Dodgers opened their three-game
series in Cincinnati even though he hadn&#39;t played in more than six weeks.

&#34;If we get him back before the All-Star break it&#39;s a bonus, but I don&#39;t see
that happening,&#34; Torre said.

Torre said that the possibility of Furcal&#39;s having to undergo back surgery
hasn&#39;t been discussed.

Entering Tuesday, the Dodgers were 18-14 in games started by Furcal and 12-24
in games he didn&#39;t.

More aggressive, better results

Left-hander Eric Stults, who was recalled from triple-A Las Vegas on Tuesday
and will become the Dodgers&#39; ninth starter of the season when he takes the
mound Thursday, said that not pitching away from contact is the reason behind
his improvement.

Stults, who has pitched in 18 major league games over the last two seasons,
was 5-6 with a 3.59 earned-run average in 14 starts with Las Vegas. He was
5-2 with a 2.98 ERA away from Las Vegas&#39; hitter-friendly Cashman Field.

&#34;You have a tendency in that league to try to miss bats,&#34; Stults said. &#34;You
can&#39;t do that.&#34;

Torre feels for Randolph

Torre said he left a voice message on the phone of Willie Randolph, who was
fired as the manager of the New York Mets early Tuesday morning. Randolph was
a coach on Torre&#39;s staff with the New York Yankees.

&#34;Because you&#39;ve been fired -- I guess I can say that three times -- it
doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing,&#34; Torre said.

依標題因該就知道是什麼意思了吧
道奇真的是衰爆了
先發投手掛兩個
Furcal還要到明星賽後
希望奇蹟出現囉...
