Infielder, a starter throughout his minor league career, says the transition
has been difficult.

By Dylan Hernandez, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
April 22, 2008

CINCINNATI -- Chin-lung Hu started Monday&#39;s game the way he started 15
previous games -- on the bench.

The role of utility infielder is one that is completely unfamiliar to Hu, the
Dodgers&#39; minor league player of the year, and something the team&#39;s coaching
staff didn&#39;t expect him to fill. But injuries to the likes of Andy LaRoche
and Tony Abreu forced the lifelong everyday player into being included on the
opening-day roster to be a late-inning defensive replacement, pinch-hitter or
pinch-runner. Monday, he took over for Jeff Kent at second base in the sixth
inning.

Hu admits the transition has been difficult.

&#34;I&#39;m used to being a starting player,&#34; he said. &#34;Right now, I need to change
my thinking. It&#39;s just kind of different, you know?&#34;

Manager Joe Torre acknowledged that Hu, a shortstop who is backing up the two
middle infield positions, isn&#39;t the ideal utility player because of the
difficulty he has playing third base. Torre said the arrangement might also
not be ideal for Hu, who is 24 years old and could be playing every day at
triple-A Las Vegas.

&#34;I still think he&#39;ll get something out of this,&#34; Torre said. &#34;Is this going
to retard his progress? I don&#39;t know.&#34;

Hu said what he finds most difficult in the role is hitting because he rarely
sees live pitching.

Noticing that Hu appeared to be bothered by his low average, third base coach
Larry Bowa made it a point to talk to him Friday in Atlanta and tell him to
forget what he was batting. Hu was hitting .200 at the time.
<span class="f3 hl">Larry Bowa 指導Hu</span>
&#34;Joe can put you up to hit right now,&#34; Bowa said he told Hu. &#34;He could hit
and run with you, ask you to bunt, ask you to steal a base, go from first to
third; he can put you at short, second or third.&#34;

Said Bowa: &#34;To me, that&#39;s very valuable. I just named five things he could do
to help the team win. Sometimes they get caught up in the numbers. That&#39;s not
what this is about.&#34;
<span class="f3 hl">Bowa&#34;我覺得Hu非常的有價值,我可以隨便講五件事情他可以幫助球隊贏球</span>
From the start of spring training, Hu has taken extra grounders from Bowa
almost daily. On the day of every home game, Bowa said, Hu is at the ballpark
at 1:30 p.m. to work with him.
<span class="f3 hl">從春訓開始,胡就一直和Bowa練習接滾地球 而在主場的比賽當天,胡總會在下午
</span><span class="f3 hl">1:30開始和他接球</span>
Hu said Bowa has especially helped him learning how to play second base, the
position he could inherit next season if the Dodgers re-sign shortstop Rafael
Furcal and lose Kent to retirement.

&#34;He&#39;s a sponge,&#34; Bowa said. &#34;This kid&#39;s not going to be a utility player. As
his career unfolds, he&#39;s probably going to be an everyday player unless
something happens to him physically.&#34;
