VERO BEACH, Fla. -- When spring training was only a few days old, the
Dodgers&#39; new manager admitted that he couldn&#39;t recognize most of his players
by sight.

Though Joe Torre might be more familiar with the faces and personalities in
his clubhouse, what they look like on the field when put in specific
situations remains something of a mystery to him. And though he has a general
idea of who could play where, Torre said that a lineup is &#34;something that&#39;s
going to come to you without having to really give it a lot of thought once
you watch them play.&#34;


Torre gets his first real look today, when the Dodgers open the exhibition
season against the Atlanta Braves at Holman Stadium.

Admittedly, the evaluation process will be difficult because the club is
obligated to send a split squad to play exhibition games in China against the
San Diego Padres on March 14 and 15. The contingent that will go to China,
which includes Torre, will be apart from the rest of the team for a week in
mid-March. The squads will converge in Arizona to finish spring training in
the Cactus League.

In the midst of this chaos, Torre will try to answer questions about his
team. Here are the five most pressing ones:

<span class="f3 hl">Who will play next to Andruw Jones?</span>

1Jones, a 10-time Gold Glove winner, became a lock to start in center field
the moment he signed a two-year, $36.2-million contract with the Dodgers in
December. But stability in one position resulted in instability in two
others, as returning players Juan Pierre, Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier find
themselves battling for playing time in the remaining outfield spots.

&#34;It&#39;s a nice problem to have,&#34; Torre said.

Ethier is vying for both spots, competing with Pierre for the job in left and
Kemp in right.

Pierre, 30, who moved out of center to make room for Jones, had 196 hits and
64 steals last season, but his on-base percentage was only .331. Kemp, 23,
might have the highest ceiling among the Dodgers&#39; promising young players,
but questions exist about his maturity. Ethier, 25, could be the most
well-rounded player in the group.

<span class="f3 hl">Speaking of Jones, can he bounce back from last season?</span>

2A five-time All-Star, Jones hit 51 home runs in 2005 and 41 a year later.
Last season, his total plunged to 26 and he hit .222.

A few explanations exist for what happened, the first being that Jones
battled elbow problems. Jones claims the injury didn&#39;t affect him, blaming
his decreased output on a batting stance that he said was too wide and a body
that he said was too slim.

Jones said he weighed in at 241 for his physical exam, 16 pounds heavier than
he did last season with the Braves.

&#34;It&#39;s a little bit of a concern,&#34; Torre said of the added weight.

Jones said that the strength he felt he lost because of the lost weight is
back and that his stance is where it should be. He said he wouldn&#39;t panic if
he didn&#39;t start hitting immediately.

&#34;In the spring, you slowly make your adjustments,&#34; he said.

<span class="f3 hl">Who starts at third: the former two-time batting champion who didn&#39;t look
</span><span class="f3 hl">like a former two-time batting champion last season or a kid with minimal
</span><span class="f3 hl">big-league experience?</span>

3Torre&#39;s options at third base are Nomar Garciaparra, who hit .283 with seven
home runs last season, and Andy LaRoche, who often looked overwhelmed in 35
big-league games last season.

Garciaparra has refused to discuss the competition at third base this spring,
saying, &#34;I don&#39;t have any thoughts about anything. I&#39;m just getting ready for
the season.&#34; Torre said he recently spoke to Garciaparra about the situation,
telling him that he had the &#34;inside track&#34; to be the starter because of his
experience.
The lack of consistency resulting from the lack of experience is a concern
for LaRoche, who hit .309 in triple-A Las Vegas but only .226 in the majors
last season. Front-office officials have noted that LaRoche initially
struggled at every new level in the minors but that he always managed to make
the necessary adjustments. The hope is that he could do that again.

<span class="f3 hl">Was Hiroki Kuroda worth $35.3 million?</span>


4Kuroda was the Dodgers&#39; only target among the weak crop of free-agent
pitchers. Assistant general manager Logan White scouted Kuroda in person in
Japan and has vouched for his ability, but the reality is that the
33-year-old right-hander still hasn&#39;t thrown a single pitch in the big
leagues. He&#39;ll get his first chance Friday, when the Dodgers visit the Braves
in Orlando.

Up to this point, Torre likes what he has seen.

&#34;He throws a variety of stuff from the same release point,&#34; Torre said. &#34;He
doesn&#39;t throw anything straight.&#34;

<span class="f3 hl">Is Jason Schmidt completely healed?</span>

5This is the question to which no one, not even Schmidt, has an answer. And
the answer will remain unknown until some point this season, when Schmidt
finds himself in a jam and is forced to let go of a pitch without considering
the consequences.

Schmidt underwent major shoulder surgery last season, the first year of a
three-year, $47-million deal. So far, he hasn&#39;t suffered any setbacks.

&#34;I&#39;m still on the right track,&#34; Schmidt said.

Whether Schmidt can be ready for opening day remains uncertain. But that is
of less concern than making sure that once he is back, he remains healthy.

If Schmidt can regain at least some of the form that made him a three-time
All-Star with the San Francisco Giants, the Dodgers&#39; rotation could be one of
the best in baseball.

Torre has said Schmidt will pitch in the exhibition season, but said he will
be cautious in how he handles him
