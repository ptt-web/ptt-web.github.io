HOUSTON -- Nearly two months after going on the disabled list and two days
after making his first minor league rehab start, Dodgers shortstop Rafael
Furcal is right back where he started -- in pain because of his back and in
doubt as to when he will play again.
<span class="f3 hl">進入傷兵名單後,近兩個月 他打了第一場的復健賽, Rafael Furcal 現在又回到
</span><span class="f3 hl">他剛開始的狀況 -- 他的背非常的痛, 不知道他什麼時候才能打</span>

Furcal went four innings at shortstop for triple-A Las Vegas on Monday,
doubling and driving in a run in three at-bats in his first game since May 5.
But when he woke Tuesday with discomfort, he was immediately called back to
Los Angeles where he will be examined today by Dr. Robert Watkins.
<span class="f3 hl">Furcal禮拜一在3A的比賽上場四局,三打數 二壘安打+一打點 但是他在禮拜二早上
</span><span class="f3 hl">起床時,他的背很不舒服, 然後他馬上回LA 今天會給醫生檢查</span>

&#34;Obviously it&#39;s not good news,&#34; Dodgers Manager Joe Torre said.
<span class="f3 hl">&#34;這非常明顯是個壞消息&#34; Torre 說</span>

&#34;He felt so good about himself, with this exercise program he was on. I&#39;m
sure for him it&#39;s really frustrating.&#34;
<span class="f3 hl">&#34;他之前都感覺很好 我相信對他而言這是非常frustrating&#34;</span>

Furcal, who missed the final two weeks last season with a sore back, played
just 32 games this year before going to the sidelines with the same problem.
He was leading the team in several categories, including average (.366) and
runs (34), and the Dodgers were four games above .500 when he went out.
<span class="f3 hl">Furcal去年最後的兩個禮拜因為背傷都沒出賽, 今年只打了32場比賽就去DL 只因
</span><span class="f3 hl">為同樣的傷痛 他曾領先著隊上許多項目 有AVG 還有RUNS 還有躲人在他消失前有超過5成
</span><span class="f3 hl">的勝率</span>

But they have gone 21-30 since then, averaging less than 3.3 runs a game.
<span class="f3 hl">但是躲人在他消失後 只有 21-30的戰績 還有每場平均攻下不到3.3分</span>

Nomar Garciaparra, who is also on rehab assignment at Las Vegas with a sore
calf, replaced Furcal at shortstop and went two for three and scored twice
Tuesday. Barring a setback, he could be with the Dodgers this weekend in San
Francisco. Andruw Jones, who had knee surgery in May, joined Garciaparra in
the 51s&#39; lineup and went three for three with two runs batted in.
<span class="f3 hl">Nomar也在3A出賽 他替代Furcal守游擊 三打數兩安打 還有兩得分 他有可能在這
</span><span class="f3 hl">周末趕上對巨人的連戰   安豬也有在3A出賽 3-3 2RBIS</span>

Ready to pitch in

Hiroki Kuroda is expected to come off the disabled list and make his first
start since June 12 tonight, and Brad Penny, who threw 50 pitches to hitters
in a three-inning simulated game at Minute Maid Park on Tuesday, is on track
to rejoin the rotation Saturday in San Francisco.
<span class="f3 hl">Kuroda今晚會先發  還有 Penny有可能在這禮拜六對巨人先發</span>

And Jason Schmidt, who hasn&#39;t pitched for the Dodgers in more than a year, is
scheduled to throw 60 pitches for Las Vegas on Thursday and could rejoin the
team about the end of July.
<span class="f3 hl">Schmidt 可能會在7月底歸隊</span>



<span class="f3 b1 hl">Dodgers send Clayton Kershaw to minors</span>

Young left-hander says he&#39;s &#39;disappointed.&#39; He was winless in eight starts in
the majors.
<span class="f3 hl">他說他非常的失望 他先發了8場  1場也沒贏</span>

HOUSTON -- The Dodgers optioned left-hander Clayton Kershaw back to the
minors today, , a day after his best major league start, to clear roster for
right-hander Hiroki Kuroda, who was set to start tonight&#39;s game against the
Astros.
<span class="f3 hl">躲人把Kershaw送回小聯盟了,他昨天才投了他在大聯盟最棒的一場,今天Kuroda先
</span><span class="f3 hl">發對上太空人</span>

&#34;I&#39;m disappointed,&#34; said Kershaw, who said the move caught him by surprise.
&#34;But I understand it&#39;s a business.&#34;
<span class="f3 hl">&#34;我非常的失望&#34;Kershaw說,他覺得讓他太吃驚了 &#34;但是我了解 棒球個商業&#34;</span>
--- <span class="f0 hl">it&#39;s是指什麼?! 我猜他說棒球</span>

 Heading out Kershaw spent part of the afternoon talking with his agent and
had just left tickets for friends when Manager Joe Torre called him into his
office to give him the bad news.

Kershaw, 20, impressed the Dodgers in spring training when he gave up just
one run after being summoned from minor league camp. But he is winless in
eight starts in the majors, although he was in line for the victory Tuesday
when he held Houston to a run and six hits before leaving with a 6-1 lead in
the sixth inning.
<span class="f3 hl">Kershaw,20歲,在春訓時讓躲人印象深刻 但他先發8場卻怎麼都贏不了,雖然禮拜二
</span><span class="f3 hl">他是勝利投手候選人 當他6局只丟一分和讓對方打出6安打</span>

Reliever Brian Falkenborg gave up a three-run homer to Ty Wigginton -- with
two of the runs being charged to Kershaw.
<span class="f3 hl">Falkenborg卻搞砸了 讓Wigginton打了三分砲 -- 兩分是Kershaw的責失</span>

The Astros tied the score an inning later on a two-out, two-run double by
Carlos Lee and Kershaw was left with a no decision. The Dodgers were
uncertain this afternoon whether Kershaw would go back to double-A
Jacksonville or triple-A Las Vegas.
<span class="f3 hl">後來太空人又把比數追平 讓Kerwhaw無關勝敗
</span><span class="f3 hl">躲人不確定要送要他去3A還是2A</span>
