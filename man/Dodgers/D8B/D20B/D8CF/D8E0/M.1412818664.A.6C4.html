Lindsey makes box score -- not batter&#39;s box

After 16 years in Minors, callup so close to first MLB at-bat


全文：

SAN DIEGO -- It took John Lindsey 16 years for this moment and just because
it lasted barely a moment, it was still the thrill of a lifetime.

&#34;It was exciting,&#34; said Lindsey, who finally made a regular-season box score
by being announced as a pinch-hitter in Wednesday night&#39;s 4-0 Dodgers loss to
the Padres, only to be immediately lifted when the Padres made a pitching
change. &#34;I was waiting for this all my life and I was a lot cooler and calmer
than I thought.&#34;

Lindsey, called up Monday after 16 years in the Minor Leagues, was sent up to
bat for Scott Podsednik and face left-hander Joe Thatcher with one out in the
top of the eighth inning and runners on first and second. But as soon as
Lindsey was announced, Padres manager Bud Black replaced Thatcher with
right-hander Luke Gregerson.

Dodgers manager Joe Torre countered by sending up Andre Ethier to bat for
Lindsey, and Ethier bounced Gregerson&#39;s first pitch into an inning-ending
double play.

&#34;It was something I had to do,&#34; Torre said. &#34;It didn&#39;t work.&#34;

Lindsey, the Pacific Coast League batting champ at Triple-A Albuquerque, said
he now has something in common with anyone who has ever played for the
Dodgers, including legends like Jackie Robinson and Sandy Koufax and Maury
Wills.

&#34;It&#39;s truly an honor,&#34; said Lindsey, at 33 the oldest non-Asian player to
debut in the Majors since 2002.

After the game, Torre said Lindsey would likely start Saturday&#39;s game in
Houston against left-handed starter Wandy Rodriguez and might start Friday
night against lefty J.A. Happ.

&#34;My mom and dad and everybody will be there. That would be pretty cool,&#34; said
Lindsey, who hails from Mississippi.

Lindsey said teammates congratulated him after the brief appearance. Torre
gave him the lineup card that has his name written in and crossed out.

&#34;That&#39;s going over the fireplace. I don&#39;t have one yet, but someday,&#34; said
Lindsey.
